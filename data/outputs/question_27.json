          "question_figure_description": "The provided image illustrates a multi-step organic reaction sequence beginning with compound X, identified as 1,4-dibromobutane-1,4-dione, depicted as an eight-membered cyclic structure containing two bromine atoms and two carbonyl groups. The transformation of X to P involves (i) Na and dry ether, followed by (ii) H3O+, with P having a molar mass of 210. Subsequently, P is converted to Q via (i) NaOH and Delta, with a 50% yield. Q then reacts to form R through treatment with (i) NaOH and CaO, also with a 50% yield. From R, two pathways diverge: one leads to T upon reaction with PBr3 in (C2H5)2O (50% yield), and the other forms S by reaction with NaH in (C2H5)2O (50% yield). The problem specifies that 16 moles of X are used and asks for the amount of S produced in grams. Atomic masses for calculations are provided: H = 1, C = 12, O = 16, and Br = 80. ",
