This is because if the degree is odd, the polynomial tends to $+\\infty$ in one direction (either $x \\to \\infty$ or $x \\to -\\infty$) and to $-\\infty$ in the other direction. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, $P(x)$ must take the value 0 for some $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSince $P(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, its degree cannot be odd.\nIf $a_3 - b_3 \\neq 0$, then $P(x)$ is a cubic polynomial (degree 3), which is odd. This would mean $P(x)$ has a real root, contradicting the given condition.\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^3$ in $P(x)$ must be zero: $a_3 - b_3 = 0$, which implies $a_3 = b_3$.\n\nNow we need to find the coefficient of $x^3$ in $h(x) = f(x+1) - g(x+2)$.\nFirst, consider $f(x+1)$:\n$f(x+1) = a_1 + 10(x+1) + a_2(x+1)^2 + a_3(x+1)^3 + (x+1)^4$.\nWe need to find the terms that contribute to $x^3$:\n1. From $a_3(x+1)^3 = a_3(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1)$, the $x^3$ term is $a_3x^3$.\n2. From $(x+1)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}x^4 + \\binom{4}{1}x^3(1)^1 + \\dots = x^4 + 4x^3 + \\dots$, the $x^3$ term is $4x^3$.\nThe terms $a_1$, $10(x+1)$, and $a_2(x+1)^2$ are of degree at most 2, so they do not contribute to the $x^3$ term.\nThus, the coefficient of $x^3$ in $f(x+1)$ is $a_3 + 4$.\n\nNext, consider $g(x+2)$:\n$g(x+2) = b_1 + 3(x+2) + b_2(x+2)^2 + b_3(x+2)^3 + (x+2)^4$.\nWe need to find the terms that contribute to $x^3$:\n1. From $b_3(x+2)^3 = b_3(x^3 + 3x^2(2) + 3x(2^2) + 2^3) = b_3(x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8)$, the $x^3$ term is $b_3x^3$.\n2. From $(x+2)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}x^4 + \\binom{4}{1}x^3(2)^1 + \\dots = x^4 + 4x^3(2) + \\dots = x^4 + 8x^3 + \\dots$, the $x^3$ term is $8x^3$.\nThe terms $b_1$, $3(x+2)$, and $b_2(x+2)^2$ are of degree at most 2, so they do not contribute to the $x^3$ term.\nThus, the coefficient of $x^3$ in $g(x+2)$ is $b_3 + 8$.\n\nThe coefficient of $x^3$ in $h(x)$ is the difference of these coefficients:\nCoefficient of $x^3$ in $h(x) = (a_3 + 4) - (b_3 + 8) = a_3 - b_3 - 4$.\nSince we established that $a_3 - b_3 = 0$, the coefficient of $x^3$ in $h(x)$ is $0 - 4 = -4$."

So, statement (A) \"The function $f$ is NOT differentiable at $x = 0$\" is FALSE.\n\nStep 2: Analyze local extremum at $x=0$.\nTo determine if $x=0$ is a point of local minima, we examine $f(x) - f(0)$ for $x$ near $0$.\n$f(0) = 2$.\nFor $x \\neq 0$, $f(x) = 2 - 2x^2 - x^2 \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}}$.\n$f(x) - f(0) = (2 - 2x^2 - x^2 \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}}) - 2 = -2x^2 - x^2 \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}} = -x^2 (2 + \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}})$.\nWe know that $-1 \\le \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}} \\le 1$.\nSo, $2 - 1 \\le 2 + \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}} \\le 2 + 1$, which means $1 \\le 2 + \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}} \\le 3$.\nThus, $2 + \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}}$ is always positive.\nSince $x^2 > 0$ for $x \\neq 0$, it follows that $x^2 (2 + \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}}) > 0$.\nTherefore, $f(x) - f(0) = -x^2 (2 + \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}}) < 0$ for $x \\neq 0$.\nThis means $f(x) < f(0)$ for all $x \\neq 0$ in any neighborhood of $0$.\nSo, $x=0$ is a point of strict local maximum, not local minimum.\nThus, statement (D) \"$x = 0$ is a point of local minima of $f$\" is FALSE.\n\nStep 3: Analyze monotonicity around $x=0$.\nFor $x \\neq 0$, we find the derivative $f'(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (2 - 2x^2 - x^2 \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}})$\n$f'(x) = -4x - \\left( (2x) \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}} + x^2 \\cos{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{x^2}) \\right)$\n$f'(x) = -4x - \\left( 2x \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}} - \\cos{\\frac{1}{x}} \\right)$\n$f'(x) = -4x - 2x \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}} + \\cos{\\frac{1}{x}}$.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate statement (B).\nStatement (B): \"There is a positive real number $\\delta$, such that $f$ is a decreasing function on the interval $(0, \\delta)$\".\nFor $f$ to be decreasing on $(0, \\delta)$, we must have $f'(x) \\le 0$ for all $x \\in (0, \\delta)$.\nConsider points $x_k = \\frac{1}{2k\\pi}$ for a positive integer $k$.

As $k \\to \\infty$, $t_k \\to 0^+$.\nSo, for any $\\delta > 0$, we can choose $k$ large enough such that $t_k \\in (0, \\delta)$.\nLet $x_k = -t_k = -\\frac{1}{(2k+1)\\pi}$. These $x_k$ are in $(-\\delta, 0)$.\nAt these points $t_k$:\n$\\sin{\\frac{1}{t_k}} = \\sin((2k+1)\\pi) = 0$.\n$\\cos{\\frac{1}{t_k}} = \\cos((2k+1)\\pi) = -1$.\nSo, $f'(x_k) = f'(-t_k) = 4t_k - 2t_k(0) + (-1) = 4t_k - 1$.\nWe want to check if $f'(x_k)$ can be negative. $4t_k - 1 < 0 \\implies 4t_k < 1 \\implies t_k < 1/4$.\n$t_k < 1/4 \\implies \\frac{1}{(2k+1)\\pi} < \\frac{1}{4} \\implies 4 < (2k+1)\\pi \\implies 2k+1 > \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\approx 1.273$.\nSince $2k+1$ must be an odd integer, the smallest odd integer greater than $1.273$ is $3$.

Since $f(0)>0$, we can divide by $f(0)$ to get $f(0)=1$.\nLet $y=-x$, then $f(x+(-x)) = f(x)f(-x)$, so $f(0) = f(x)f(-x)$, which means $1 = f(x)f(-x)$.\nFor any integer $n \\ge 1$, $f(nx) = f(x+x+...+x)$ (n times) $= f(x)f(x)...f(x) = (f(x))^n$.\nThis also holds for $n=0$: $f(0x)=f(0)=1$ and $(f(x))^0=1$.\nFor negative integers, let $n = -m$ where $m>0$.\n$f(nx) = f(-mx) = 1/f(mx) = 1/(f(x))^m = (f(x))^{-m} = (f(x))^n$.\nSo, $f(nx) = (f(x))^n$ for all integers $n$.\n\nStep 2: Use the information about the arithmetic progression $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{50}$.\nLet the first term be $A$ and the common difference be $D$. So $a_n = A + (n-1)D$.\nWe are given $f(a_{31}) = 64f(a_{25})$.\n$a_{31} = A + 30D$ and $a_{25} = A + 24D$.\nSo $a_{31} = a_{25} + 6D$.\nTherefore, $f(a_{31}) = f(a_{25} + 6D) = f(a_{25})f(6D)$.\nSubstituting this into the given equation: $f(a_{25})f(6D) = 64f(a_{25})$.\nSince $f(a_{25}) > 0$, we can divide by $f(a_{25})$ to get $f(6D) = 64$.\nUsing the property $f(nx)=(f(x))^n$, we have $f(6D) = (f(D))^6$.\nSo, $(f(D))^6 = 64$.\nSince $f(x)>0$ for all $x$, $f(D)$ must be a positive real number.\nThus, $f(D) = (64)^{1/6} = (2^6)^{1/6} = 2$.\n\nStep 3: Express $f(a_i)$ and analyze the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{50} f(a_i)$.\n$f(a_i) = f(A + (i-1)D) = f(A)f((i-1)D)$.\nSince $(i-1)$ is an integer, $f((i-1)D) = (f(D))^{i-1}$.\nSo, $f(a_i) = f(A)(f(D))^{i-1}$.\nLet $K = f(A)$ and $r = f(D)$.

      "reasoning": "Part (P): Let $p(x) = 10x^3 - 45x^2 + 60x + 35$. We find $p'(x) = 30x^2 - 90x + 60 = 30(x-1)(x-2)$. For $x \\in (1,2)$, $p'(x) < 0$, so $p(x)$ is strictly decreasing on $[1,2]$.\n$p(1) = 10 - 45 + 60 + 35 = 60$.\n$p(2) = 10(8) - 45(4) + 60(2) + 35 = 80 - 180 + 120 + 35 = 55$.\nLet $H(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{n}$. The range of $H(x)$ on $[1,2]$ is $[\\frac{55}{n}, \\frac{60}{n}]$.\nFor $f(x) = [H(x)]$ to be continuous on $[1,2]$, since $H(x)$ is strictly decreasing, it is necessary that $H(x)$ does not cross any integer values. This means the entire range of $H(x)$ must lie within an interval $[k, k+1)$ for some integer $k$. \nSo, $k \\le H(x) < k+1$ for all $x \\in [1,2]$.\nThis implies $k \\le \\min_{x \\in [1,2]} H(x)$ and $\\max_{x \\in [1,2]} H(x) < k+1$.\nSo, $k \\le \\frac{55}{n}$ and $\\frac{60}{n} < k+1$.\nThis means $\\frac{60}{n} - 1 < k \\le \\frac{55}{n}$.\nFor such an integer $k$ to exist, the interval $(\\frac{60}{n}-1, \\frac{55}{n}]$ must contain an integer.\nLet's test natural numbers $n$.\nIf $n=1,2,3,4$, $\\frac{55}{n} < \\frac{60}{n}-1$, so the interval is empty or invalid.\nIf $n=5$: Interval is $(\\frac{60}{5}-1, \\frac{55}{5}] = (11, 11]$. So $k=11$. Check conditions: $11 \\le \\frac{55}{5}$ (True, $11 \\le 11$). $\\frac{60}{5} < 11+1$ (False, $12 < 12$ is false).\nIf $n=6$: Interval is $(\\frac{60}{6}-1, \\frac{55}{6}] = (9, \\frac{55}{6}] \\approx (9, 9.16]$. No integer $k$.\nIf $n=7$: Interval is $(\\frac{60}{7}-1, \\frac{55}{7}] = (\\frac{53}{7}, \\frac{55}{7}] \\approx (7.57, 7.85]$. No integer $k$.\nIf $n=8$: Interval is $(\\frac{60}{8}-1, \\frac{55}{8}] = (\\frac{52}{8}, \\frac{55}{8}] = (6.5, 6.875]$. No integer $k$.\nIf $n=9$: Interval is $(\\frac{60}{9}-1, \\frac{55}{9}] = (\\frac{51}{9}, \\frac{55}{9}] = (\\frac{17}{3}, \\frac{55}{9}] \\approx (5.66, 6.11]$. Integer $k=6$. Check conditions: $6 \\le \\frac{55}{9}$ (True, $6 \\le 6.11...$). $\\frac{60}{9} < 6+1$ (True, $6.66... < 7$).\nSo, the minimum value of $n$ is 9. (P) matches (2).\n\nPart (Q): $g(x) = (2n^2 - 13n - 15)(x^3 + 3x)$. For $g(x)$ to be increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, $g'(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$g'(x) = (2n^2 - 13n - 15)(3x^2 + 3) = 3(2n^2 - 13n - 15)(x^2+1)$.\nSince $x^2+1 > 0$, we need $2n^2 - 13n - 15 \\ge 0$.\nThe roots of $2n^2 - 13n - 15 = 0$ are $n = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{(-13)^2 - 4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169+120}}{4} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{289}}{4} = \\frac{13 \\pm 17}{4}$.\nSo $n_1 = \\frac{13-17}{4} = -1$ and $n_2 = \\frac{13+17}{4} = \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5$.\nThus, $2(n+1)(n-7.5) \\ge 0$. This implies $n \\le -1$ or $n \\ge 7.5$.\nSince $n$ is a natural number, $n \\ge 1$. So we need $n \\ge 7.5$. The minimum natural number $n$ is 8. (Q) matches (1).\n\nPart (R): $h(x) = (x^2 - 9)^n(x^2 + 2x + 3) = (x-3)^n (x+3)^n (x^2+2x+3)$.\nLet $k(x) = (x+3)^n (x^2+2x+3)$. At $x=3$, $k(3) = (3+3)^n (3^2+2(3)+3) = 6^n(18) > 0$. So $k(x)>0$ for $x$ near $3$.\n$h(x) = (x-3)^n k(x)$. We have $h(3)=0$.\nFor $x=3$ to be a point of local minima, $h(x) \\ge h(3)=0$ for $x$ in a neighborhood of $3$.\nSince $k(x)>0$ near $x=3$, we need $(x-3)^n \\ge 0$ near $x=3$. This holds if $n$ is an even number.\nIf $n$ is odd, $(x-3)^n$ changes sign at $x=3$, so $h(x)$ changes sign, and $x=3$ is not a local minimum.\nWe are given that $n$ is a natural number and $n>5$. The smallest even natural number $n>5$ is $n=6$. (R) matches (4).\n\nPart (S): $l(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} (\\sin|x - k| + \\cos|x - k + \\frac{1}{2}|)$.\nThe function $\\sin|u|$ is not differentiable at $u=0$. Its right derivative is 1 and left derivative is -1.\nSo $\\sin|x-k|$ is not differentiable at $x=k$.\nThe function $\\cos|v|$. Let $F(v) = \\cos|v|$. For $v>0$, $F'(v)=-\\sin v \to 0$ as $v \to 0^+$. For $v<0$, $F(v)=\\cos(-v)=\\cos v$, $F'(v)=-\\sin v \to 0$ as $v \to 0^-$. Since $F(v)$ is continuous and left/right derivatives at $v=0$ are equal (to 0), $\\cos|v|$ is differentiable at $v=0$ (and its derivative is 0). So $\\cos|v|$ is differentiable everywhere.\nTherefore, $\\cos|x-k+\\frac{1}{2}|$ is differentiable for all $x$ and for all $k$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\cos|x - k + \\frac{1}{2}|$ is differentiable everywhere.\nSo $l(x)$ is not differentiable if and only if $\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sin|x-k|$ is not differentiable.\nLet $S(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sin|x-k|$.\nConsider a point $x_0 = j$ where $j \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$.\n$S(x) = \\sin|x-j| + \\sum_{k \ne j, k=0}^4 \\sin|x-k|$.\nAt $x_0=j$, $\\sin|x-j|$ is not differentiable. For $k \ne j$, $x-k = j-k \ne 0$, so $\\sin|x-k|$ is differentiable at $x_0=j$. Thus, the sum $\\sum_{k \ne j, k=0}^4 \\sin|x-k|$ is differentiable at $x_0=j$.\nTherefore, $S(x)$ (and $l(x)$) is not differentiable at $x_0=j$ for $j \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$.\nThese are $5$ points: $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. (S) matches (3).\n\nMatching: (P)→(2), (Q)→(1), (R)→(4), (S)→(3).\nThis corresponds to option (B)."

The angle of rotation at time $t$ is $\theta = \\omega t$.\nLet's define the normal vector $\\vec{n}$ to the loop. Initially, at $t=0$, the loop is in the XZ plane. We can choose the normal vector to be along the +Y axis, so $\\vec{n}(0) = \\hat{j}$. As the loop rotates clockwise about the X-axis (viewed from +X), the normal vector $\\hat{j}$ rotates towards $\\hat{k}$. So, the normal vector at time $t$ is $\\vec{n}(t) = \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{j} + \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{k}$.\nThe area vector is $\\vec{A}(t) = L^2 \\vec{n}(t) = L^2 (\\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{j} + \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{k})$.\n\nThe magnetic field is given by $\\vec{B}(t) = B_0 (\\cos \\omega t) \\hat{k}$ for $y \\ge 0$, and $\\vec{B} = 0$ for $y < 0$.\nWhen the loop rotates, its y-coordinates are of the form $y = z' \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $z'$ is the initial z-coordinate of a point on the loop (assuming the hinged edge is at $z=0$ and the top edge at $z=L$).\nFor $0 \\le \\omega t \\le \\pi$, $\\sin(\\omega t) \\ge 0$, so $y \\ge 0$.

Since $\\omega > 0$, $\\Phi(t)$ is positive and increasing. The induced EMF must oppose this increase. The chosen normal $\\vec{n}(t)$ has a positive $\\hat{k}$ component for small $t > 0$ ($\\sin(\\omega t) > 0$). The magnetic field $\\vec{B}(t)$ is also in the $\\hat{k}$ direction (for $\\cos(\\omega t) > 0$). So the flux is in the direction of $\\vec{n}$'s $\\hat{k}$-component. To oppose the increase in this flux, the induced current must create a magnetic field in the $-\\hat{k}$ direction. A positive EMF (and current) would create a field in the direction of $\\vec{n}$. Thus, the induced EMF must be negative. Our result $V(0) = -V_0$ is consistent with this."

If the loop were to stop while still entering (i.e., $v(t) \\to 0$ for some $y < L$):\n    $v(t) = v_0 e^{-Kt} = 0$ implies $t \\to \\infty$.\n    The maximum distance the loop would travel if this force law acted indefinitely is $y_{max} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y(t) = \\frac{v_0}{K}$.\n    So, if $v_0/K < L$, the loop stops (its velocity approaches zero) at $y = v_0/K$ as $t \\to \\infty$. It does not completely enter the field.\n2.  If $v_0/K = L$, the loop stops as it just completely enters the field. $y_{max}=L$, and this also happens as $t \\to \\infty$. The velocity $v(t) \\to 0$ as $y(t) \\to L$.\n3.  If $v_0/K > L$, the loop will completely enter the field at some finite time $t_1$.\n    Set $y(t_1)=L$: $L = \\frac{v_0}{K}(1-e^{-Kt_1})$.\n    $1 - e^{-Kt_1} = \\frac{KL}{v_0}$.\n    $e^{-Kt_1} = 1 - \\frac{KL}{v_0} = \\frac{v_0-KL}{v_0}$.\n    $-Kt_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{v_0-KL}{v_0}\\right)$.\n    $t_1 = \\frac{1}{K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{v_0}{v_0-KL}\\right)$. This is valid since $v_0 > KL \\implies v_0-KL > 0$.\n    The velocity of the loop at time $t_1$ is $v(t_1) = v_0 e^{-Kt_1} = v_0 \\left(\\frac{v_0-KL}{v_0}\\right) = v_0-KL$.\n    Since $v_0 > KL$, $v(t_1) > 0$.\n    For $t > t_1$, the loop is completely inside the magnetic field ($y(t) \\ge L$). The magnetic flux $\\Phi = B_0 L^2$ through the loop is constant. So, the induced emf $e = -d\\Phi/dt = 0$. This means the induced current $I=0$, and thus the magnetic force $F_{mag}=0$.\n    Therefore, for $t > t_1$, the loop moves with constant velocity $v(t_1) = v_0-KL$. It will not stop.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) If $v_0 = 1.5KL$, the loop will stop before it enters completely inside the region of magnetic field.\nHere $v_0 = 1.5KL$. So $v_0/K = 1.5L$.\nSince $v_0/K = 1.5L > L$, this is case 3. The loop will completely enter the field.\nThe velocity upon complete entry is $v_1 = v_0 - KL = 1.5KL - KL = 0.5KL$.\nSince $v_1 = 0.5KL > 0$, the loop continues to move with this constant velocity and never stops.\nThus, the statement is incorrect.\n\n(B) When the complete loop is inside the region of magnetic field, the net force acting on the loop is zero.\nAs discussed above (case 3, for $t>t_1$), when the loop is completely inside the uniform magnetic field, the magnetic flux through it is constant ($\\Phi = B_0 L^2$). Therefore, the induced emf is zero ($e = -d\\Phi/dt = 0$), leading to zero induced current ($I=0$). Consequently, the net magnetic force on the loop is zero.\nThus, the statement is correct.\n\n(C) If $v_0 = \\frac{KL}{10}$, the loop comes to rest at $t = (\\frac{1}{K})\\ln{(\\frac{5}{2})}$.\nHere $v_0 = KL/10$. So $v_0/K = L/10$.\nSince $v_0/K = L/10 < L$, this is case 1. The loop will stop (velocity approaches zero) before completely entering the field, at $y = L/10$, as $t \\to \\infty$.\nThe statement claims the loop comes to rest at a finite time $t_C = (\\frac{1}{K})\\ln{(\\frac{5}{2})}$.\nLet's find the velocity at this time: $v(t_C) = v_0 e^{-Kt_C} = v_0 e^{-K (\\frac{1}{K})\\ln(5/2)} = v_0 e^{-\\ln(5/2)} = v_0 (2/5)$.\nSince $v_0 = KL/10 \\ne 0$, $v(t_C) = (KL/10)(2/5) = KL/25 \\ne 0$.\nSo the loop has not come to rest at this time.\nThus, the statement is incorrect.\n\n(D) If $v_0 = 3KL$, the complete loop enters inside the region of magnetic field at time $t = (\\frac{1}{K})\\ln{(\\frac{3}{2})}$.\nHere $v_0 = 3KL$. So $v_0/K = 3L$.\nSince $v_0/K = 3L > L$, this is case 3. The loop will completely enter the field.\nThe time $t_1$ for complete entry is $t_1 = \\frac{1}{K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{v_0}{v_0-KL}\\right)$.\nSubstitute $v_0 = 3KL$:\n$t_1 = \\frac{1}{K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{3KL}{3KL-KL}\\right) = \\frac{1}{K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{3KL}{2KL}\\right) = \\frac{1}{K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$.\nThis matches the time given in the statement.\nThus, the statement is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements (B) and (D) are correct.\n\nFinal check of the direction of current and force:\nLoop moving in +y direction. $\\vec{B} = B_0 \\hat{k}$ (+z direction).\nFlux $\\Phi = \\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$. Area vector $\\vec{A}$ can be taken as $A\\hat{k}$. So flux is $B_0 \\times (\\text{Area inside field})$.\nArea inside field is $L \\times y(t)$ (assuming $y(t)$ is the length of the segment of the loop that has entered the field).\nSo $\\Phi = B_0 L y(t)$.\n$e = -d\\Phi/dt = -B_0 L (dy/dt) = -B_0 L v$. The magnitude is $B_0 L v$.\nThe negative sign indicates that the induced current opposes the change in flux. Flux is increasing, so induced B-field is in $-\\hat{k}$ direction. This means current is clockwise.\nIf current is clockwise:\nBottom wire (length L, from $x=0$ to $x=L$): current in $+\\hat{i}$ direction. $\\vec{F}_1 = I(L\\hat{i}) \\times (B_0\\hat{k}) = ILB_0(-\\hat{j})$.\nTop wire (if in field): current in $-\\hat{i}$ direction. $\\vec{F}_2 = I(-L\\hat{i}) \\times (B_0\\hat{k}) = ILB_0(\\hat{j})$.\nRight wire: current in $-\\hat{j}$ direction. $\\vec{F}_3 = I(-y_{in}\\hat{j}) \\times (B_0\\hat{k}) = -Iy_{in}B_0(\\hat{i})$.\nLeft wire: current in $+\\hat{j}$ direction. $\\vec{F}_4 = I(y_{in}\\hat{j}) \\times (B_0\\hat{k}) = Iy_{in}B_0(\\hat{i})$.\nForces on vertical wires $\\vec{F}_3$ and $\\vec{F}_4$ cancel.\nWhen entering, only the bottom wire experiences this force $F_1 = -ILB_0\\hat{j}$. This force opposes motion.\nMagnitude $F = ILB_0 = (\\frac{B_0Lv}{R})LB_0 = \\frac{B_0^2L^2v}{R}$.\nSo the equation of motion $M \\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{B_0^2 L^2 v}{R}$ is correct. My initial reasoning on current direction was mixed up, but the final force equation was correct due to Lenz's law. The detailed check confirms counter-clockwise current for force in -y direction.\nWait, if current is clockwise:\nBottom wire: current from right to left, so $\\vec{L} = -L\\hat{i}$. $\\vec{F}_B = I(-L\\hat{i}) \\times (B_0\\hat{k}) = -ILB_0 (\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{k}) = -ILB_0(-\\hat{j}) = ILB_0\\hat{j}$. This is in direction of motion. This is wrong.\n\nLet's use motional EMF. For a conductor of length $\\vec{l}$ moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$ in field $\\vec{B}$, emf $e = (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot \\vec{l}$.\nBottom wire: $\\vec{v} = v\\hat{j}$, $\\vec{B}=B_0\\hat{k}$. $\\vec{v}\\times\\vec{B} = vB_0 (\\hat{j}\\times\\hat{k}) = vB_0\\hat{i}$.\nIf $\\vec{l}$ is taken from left to right ($L\\hat{i}$), then $e = (vB_0\\hat{i}) \\cdot (L\\hat{i}) = vB_0L$. This means higher potential on the right. So current flows from left to right in the bottom wire. This is counter-clockwise.\nForce on bottom wire: $\\vec{L}_{eff} = L\\hat{i}$. Current $I = e/R = vB_0L/R$.\n$\\vec{F} = I (\\vec{L}_{eff} \\times \\vec{B}) = I (L\\hat{i} \\times B_0\\hat{k}) = I L B_0 (\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{k}) = I L B_0 (-\\hat{j})$.\nThis force is in the $-\\hat{j}$ direction, opposing motion. Its magnitude is $F = \\frac{vB_0L}{R} L B_0 = \\frac{B_0^2L^2v}{R}$.\nThis confirms the equation of motion and all subsequent calculations."

The dimensions are given as:\nLength (L) = 10.5 cm\nBreadth (B) = 0.05 mm\nThickness (T) = 6.0 µm\n\nFirst, we need to convert all dimensions to a common unit, cm, and determine the number of significant figures for each measurement.\n\n1.  **Length (L):**\n    L = 10.5 cm\n    This measurement has 3 significant figures (1, 0, 5).\n\n2.  **Breadth (B):**\n    B = 0.05 mm\n    To convert to cm: 1 mm = 0.1 cm.\n    B = 0.05 mm × (0.1 cm / 1 mm) = 0.005 cm.\n    In 0.005 cm, the leading zeros are not significant. Only the digit '5' is significant.\n    So, B has 1 significant figure.\n    Alternatively, B = 5 × 10⁻² mm = 5 × 10⁻³ cm, which clearly shows 1 significant figure.\n\n3.  **Thickness (T):**\n    T = 6.0 µm\n    To convert to cm: 1 µm = 10⁻⁶ m, and 1 m = 100 cm. So, 1 µm = 10⁻⁴ cm.\n    T = 6.0 µm × (10⁻⁴ cm / 1 µm) = 6.0 × 10⁻⁴ cm.\n    In 6.0 × 10⁻⁴ cm, both '6' and the trailing '0' (since it's after the decimal point in 6.0) are significant.\n    So, T has 2 significant figures.\n\nNext, we calculate the volume (V = L × B × T):\nV = (10.5 cm) × (0.005 cm) × (6.0 × 10⁻⁴ cm)\nV = (10.5) × (5 × 10⁻³) × (6.0 × 10⁻⁴) cm³\nV = (10.5 × 5 × 6.0) × 10⁻³ × 10⁻⁴ cm³\nV = (52.5 × 6.0) × 10⁻⁷ cm³\n\nLet's calculate 52.5 × 6.0:\n   52.5\n× 6.0\n-----\n  000  (52.5 × 0)\n31500 (52.5 × 6, shifted)\n-----\n315.00\n\nSo, V = 315.00 × 10⁻⁷ cm³\nV = 3.1500 × 10² × 10⁻⁷ cm³\nV = 3.1500 × 10⁻⁵ cm³\n\nNow, we need to determine the correct number of significant figures for the result. When multiplying measurements, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures.\n-   L (10.5 cm) has 3 significant figures.\n-   B (0.005 cm) has 1 significant figure.\n-   T (6.0 × 10⁻⁴ cm) has 2 significant figures.\n\nThe minimum number of significant figures is 1 (from the breadth B).\nTherefore, the volume V must be rounded to 1 significant figure.\n\nCalculated volume V = 3.1500 × 10⁻⁵ cm³.\nTo round this to 1 significant figure:\nThe first significant digit is '3'. The next digit is '1'. Since 1 < 5, we round down, meaning we keep the '3' as it is and drop the subsequent digits.\nSo, V ≈ 3 × 10⁻⁵ cm³.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n(A) 3.2 x 10⁻⁵ cm³\n    -   This value has 2 significant figures (3 and 2).\n    -   The required number of significant figures is 1. So, this option does not have the \"correct significant figures\".\n\n(B) 32.0 × 10⁻⁶ cm³\n    -   This can be written as 3.20 × 10⁻⁵ cm³.\n    -   This value has 3 significant figures (3, 2, and 0).\n    -   The required number of significant figures is 1. So, this option does not have the \"correct significant figures\".\n\n(C) 3.0 × 10⁻⁵ cm³\n    -   This value has 2 significant figures (3 and 0).\n    -   The required number of significant figures is 1. So, this option does not have the \"correct significant figures\".\n    -   Numerically, 3.1500 × 10⁻⁵ rounded to 2 significant figures would be 3.2 × 10⁻⁵ (since the digit after '1' is '5'). So 3.0 × 10⁻⁵ is not the correct rounding to 2 s.f. either.\n\n(D) 3 × 10⁻⁵ cm³\n    -   This value has 1 significant figure (the '3').\n    -   This matches the required number of significant figures (1).\n    -   The value 3 × 10⁻⁵ is the result of rounding 3.1500 × 10⁻⁵ to 1 significant figure.\n    -   Therefore, this option gives the volume with correct significant figures.\n\nBased on the standard rules for significant figures, only option (D) is correct. The question asks for option(s) that give the volume \"with correct significant figures\", which means both the numerical value (after proper rounding) and the number of significant figures in the representation must be correct."

      "reasoning": "**Scenario 1: Two plates P and Q (Fig. 1)**\nPlates P and Q are perfect black bodies at absolute temperatures $T_P$ and $T_Q$ respectively, with $T_P > T_Q$.\nThe net radiated power transferred per unit area from plate P to plate Q, $W_0$, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for two large parallel black plates:\n$W_0 = \\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This represents heat transfer across one \"gap\".\n\n**Scenario 2: Four plates P, S1, S2, Q (Fig. 2)**\nTwo additional identical plates (let's call them S1 and S2, as they are identical to P and Q, they are also perfect black bodies) are introduced between P and Q. Let their steady-state temperatures be $T_{S1}$ and $T_{S2}$ such that $T_P > T_{S1} > T_{S2} > T_Q$.\nHeat transfer takes place only between adjacent plates. In steady state, the net power transferred per unit area, $W_s$, must be the same across each gap:\n1.  Power transfer from P to S1: $W_s = \\sigma (T_P^4 - T_{S1}^4)$\n2.  Power transfer from S1 to S2: $W_s = \\sigma (T_{S1}^4 - T_{S2}^4)$\n3.  Power transfer from S2 to Q: $W_s = \\sigma (T_{S2}^4 - T_Q^4)$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express the temperature differences in terms of $W_s$:\n$T_P^4 - T_{S1}^4 = \\frac{W_s}{\\sigma}$  (Eq. 1)\n$T_{S1}^4 - T_{S2}^4 = \\frac{W_s}{\\sigma}$ (Eq. 2)\n$T_{S2}^4 - T_Q^4 = \\frac{W_s}{\\sigma}$  (Eq. 3)\n\nSumming these three equations:\n$(T_P^4 - T_{S1}^4) + (T_{S1}^4 - T_{S2}^4) + (T_{S2}^4 - T_Q^4) = \\frac{W_s}{\\sigma} + \\frac{W_s}{\\sigma} + \\frac{W_s}{\\sigma}$\nThe intermediate temperature terms $T_{S1}^4$ and $T_{S2}^4$ cancel out:\n$T_P^4 - T_Q^4 = 3 \\frac{W_s}{\\sigma}$\nSo, the power transferred per unit area in this configuration is:\n$W_s = \\frac{\\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)}{3}$\n\nThis setup involves 3 gaps for heat transfer (P-S1, S1-S2, S2-Q). In general, if there are $N$ such gaps in series for black body radiation, the net heat transfer is $W = \\frac{\\sigma (T_{hot}^4 - T_{cold}^4)}{N}$.\nIn Scenario 1, there is 1 gap, so $N=1$. $W_0 = \\frac{\\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)}{1}$.\nIn Scenario 2, there are 2 intermediate plates, creating 3 gaps, so $N=3$. $W_s = \\frac{\\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)}{3}$.\n\n**Calculating the ratio $\\frac{W_0}{W_s}$**\nWe have:\n$W_0 = \\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)$\n$W_s = \\frac{\\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)}{3}$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$\\frac{W_0}{W_s} = \\frac{\\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)}{\\frac{\\sigma (T_P^4 - T_Q^4)}{3}} = \\frac{1}{1/3} = 3$.\n\nThe numerical value of the ratio is 3.

A very thin glass layer is present at the point O so that the air cavity (refractive index n = 1) remains inside the glass sphere. An unpolarized, unidirectional and monochromatic light source S emits a light ray from a point inside the glass sphere towards the periphery of the glass sphere. If the light is reflected from the point O and is fully polarized, then the angle of incidence at the inner surface of the glass sphere is $\\theta$. The value of sin $\\theta$ is _______",

      "marks_awarded": 4,
      "is_correct": true,
      "reasoning": "1.  **Brewster's Angle**: The light reflected from point O on the air cavity is fully polarized. This means the angle of incidence at O, let's call it $i_B$, is Brewster's angle. The light travels from glass (refractive index $n_g = \\sqrt{3}$) to air (refractive index $n_a = 1$).\n    Brewster's angle is given by $\\tan(i_B) = \\frac{n_a}{n_g} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n    Thus, $i_B = 30^\\circ$. The angle of reflection at O is also $30^\\circ$.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of Point O's Location**: The problem states, \"A very thin glass layer is present at the point O so that the air cavity (refractive index n = 1) remains inside the glass sphere.\" Point O is on the surface of the air cavity. Let C1 be the center of the glass sphere (radius R) and C2 be the center of the air cavity (radius R/2). The phrase \"A very thin glass layer is present at the point O\" means that the thickness of the glass separating the cavity at O from the outside of the sphere is very small. This thickness, measured along the radial line from C1 through O, is $R - C1O$. For this layer to be \"very thin\", $C1O$ must be very close to R. Since a definite numerical value is required for the answer, we assume this implies $C1O = R$.\n    If $C1O = R$ and O is on the surface of the air cavity (so $C2O = R/2$), then the air cavity must be tangent to the glass sphere at point O. This means C1, C2, and O are collinear, with C2 located between C1 and O. The distance between the centers is $C1C2 = C1O - C2O = R - R/2 = R/2$.\n\n3.  **Normals and Geometry of Reflection**:\n    The normal to the air cavity surface at point O is along the line C2O. Since C1, C2, and O are collinear, this normal is also along the line C1O.\n    The light ray SO is incident at O. The reflected ray is OP, where P is a point on the inner surface of the glass sphere. The angle between the reflected ray OP and the normal C1O is equal to the angle of reflection, which is $30^\\circ$.\n    So, in the triangle C1OP, the angle $\\angle C1OP = 30^\\circ$.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Triangle C1OP**:\n    Consider the triangle formed by C1 (center of the large sphere), O (point of reflection), and P (point of incidence on the large sphere).\n    -   $C1O = R$ (as established from the \"thin glass layer\" condition, meaning O is at the surface of the large sphere).\n    -   $C1P = R$ (P is a point on the inner surface of the glass sphere, so its distance from the center C1 is R).\n    -   $\\angle C1OP = 30^\\circ$ (this is the angle between the reflected ray OP and the line C1O, which is normal to the reflecting surface at O).\n\n    The angle of incidence at P is $\\theta$. The normal at P to the surface of the glass sphere is the line C1P (since C1 is the center of the sphere). Therefore, $\\theta$ is the angle between the ray OP and the normal C1P. In $\\triangle C1OP$, this is the angle $\\angle C1PO$.\n\n5.  **Isosceles Triangle Property**:\n    Since $C1O = R$ and $C1P = R$, the triangle $\\triangle C1OP$ is an isosceles triangle with $C1O = C1P$.\n    In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal.\n    -   The angle opposite side C1P is $\\angle C1OP$.\n    -   The angle opposite side C1O is $\\angle C1PO$.\n    Therefore, $\\angle C1PO = \\angle C1OP$.\n    Since $\\angle C1OP = 30^\\circ$, we have $\\theta = \\angle C1PO = 30^\\circ$.\n\n6.  **Calculate $\\sin\\theta$**:\n    We need to find the value of $\\sin\\theta$.\n    $\\sin\\theta = \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n7.  **Final Numerical Value**:\n    $\\sin\\theta = 0.5$. As per instructions, if the numerical value has more than two decimal places, truncate/round-off to TWO decimal places. Here, $0.5$ can be written as $0.50$."

Graph (2) is the only graph with I_max = 6A. The fact that current in (R) leads, while Graph (2) is depicted as \"in phase\", suggests a compromise: the graph represents the correct amplitude, and its \"in-phase\" appearance is a simplification or the best available fit among the choices.\n\nNow we need to decide the match for (Q) based on options (A) and (C).\n**(Q)** has I_max = 6 A, current lags.\nOption (A) suggests Q→5:\n   Graph (5) shows I_max = 5 A, current leads.\n   Comparing (Q) (6A, lags) with Graph (5) (5A, leads):\n     - Peak current mismatch (6A vs 5A).\n     - Phase characteristic mismatch (lags vs leads). This is a very poor match.\n\nOption (C) suggests Q→4:\n   Graph (4) shows I_max = 5 A, current lags.\n   Comparing (Q) (6A, lags) with Graph (4) (5A, lags):\n     - Peak current mismatch (6A vs 5A).\n     - Phase characteristic matches (both lag). This is a better match than Q→5, as the nature of the phase shift is correctly represented, even if the amplitude is not exact.\n\nConsidering the choices, option (C) provides the most consistent set of matches, given the unavoidable compromises:\n-   P→3: Perfect match (10A, in phase).\n-   Q→4: Phase characteristic (lags) matches. Amplitude mismatches (6A vs 5A).\n-   R→2: Amplitude (6A) matches. Phase characteristic (leads) is simplified to \"in phase\" in the graph.\n-   S→1: Perfect match (5A, in phase).\n\nThis set of pairings is the most reasonable interpretation.\n\nFinal check of option (C): P→3, Q→4, R→2, S→1.\n- P (10A, in phase) matches Graph 3 (10A, in phase). Correct.\n- Q (6A, lags) matches Graph 4 (5A, lags). Phase type matches, amplitude differs.\n- R (6A, leads) matches Graph 2 (6A, in phase).

      "reasoning": "The reaction involves permanganate ion (MnO₄⁻) and iodide ion (I⁻) in a neutral aqueous medium.\nIn a neutral or faintly alkaline medium, MnO₄⁻ is reduced to MnO₂. The half-reaction is:\nMnO₄⁻ + 2H₂O + 3e⁻ → MnO₂ + 4OH⁻\n\nIodide ion (I⁻) is oxidized. The common oxidation product of iodide by permanganate in neutral or faintly alkaline solution is iodate ion (IO₃⁻). The half-reaction for the oxidation of I⁻ to IO₃⁻ can be written as:\nI⁻ + 3H₂O → IO₃⁻ + 6H⁺ + 6e⁻ (if we consider H⁺)\nor, more appropriately for neutral/alkaline conditions generated by the first half-reaction:\nI⁻ + 6OH⁻ → IO₃⁻ + 3H₂O + 6e⁻\n\nTo combine these half-reactions, we need to balance the electrons.\nMultiply the reduction half-reaction by 2:\n2MnO₄⁻ + 4H₂O + 6e⁻ → 2MnO₂ + 8OH⁻\nThe oxidation half-reaction is:\nI⁻ + 6OH⁻ → IO₃⁻ + 3H₂O + 6e⁻\n\nAdding these two half-reactions gives:\n2MnO₄⁻ + 4H₂O + I⁻ + 6OH⁻ → 2MnO₂ + 8OH⁻ + IO₃⁻ + 3H₂O\nSimplifying the equation by subtracting 3H₂O from both sides and 6OH⁻ from both sides:\n2MnO₄⁻ + I⁻ + H₂O → 2MnO₂ + IO₃⁻ + 2OH⁻\n\nThis balanced equation shows that one of the products formed from the iodide ion is iodate ion (IO₃⁻). While I₂ can be formed under certain conditions (e.g., acidic medium or with limiting permanganate), the standard product in neutral or faintly alkaline medium with sufficient permanganate is IO₃⁻. Periodate (IO₄⁻) formation requires stronger oxidizing conditions. Iodite (IO₂⁻) is generally an unstable intermediate. Therefore, IO₃⁻ is the most appropriate answer."

      "reasoning": "The acidity of a hydrogen atom is determined by the stability of the conjugate base formed upon its deprotonation. We need to compare the stability of the carbanions formed from each of the given hydrocarbons.\n\n1.  **Option (A) and (C):**\n    In (A), the depicted hydrogen is on a methyl group attached to the ring. In (C), it's on one of two methyl groups attached to the ring. Assuming these methyl groups are not in an allylic position relative to the exocyclic double bond, removal of H+ will form a primary carbanion (`R-CH2(-)`). These carbanions are not resonance-stabilized by the exocyclic double bond. Primary carbanions without resonance stabilization are relatively unstable.\n\n2.  **Option (B) and (D):**\n    The description for both (B) and (D) states: \"A methyl group is attached to the ring, and the depicted hydrogen is attached to the carbon adjacent to the ring.\" The phrase \"carbon adjacent to the ring\" is interpreted as an allylic carbon within the five-membered ring (i.e., a carbon atom in the ring that is adjacent to the ring carbon forming the exocyclic double bond). Hydrogens on such carbons are allylic.\n    Let the exocyclic double bond be `C1(=CH2)`, where C1 is a ring carbon. The allylic carbons in the ring are C2 and C5.\n\n    *   **For Option (B):** We assume the depicted H is on an allylic carbon that is part of a `-CH2-` group in the ring (e.g., at C2). The \"methyl group attached to the ring\" is assumed to be at a different position on the ring, not on C2. Deprotonation of this H leads to a secondary allylic carbanion.\n        Example structure of conjugate base (one resonance form):\n        ```\n              CH2\n             //\n            C1\n           / \\\n          HC(-) C5  (Negative charge on a secondary ring carbon, C2)\n          |     |\n         ...---...\n        ```\n        This carbanion is resonance-stabilized, with the charge delocalized onto the exocyclic carbon:\n        `...-CH(-)-C1=CH2  <-->  ...-CH=C1-CH2(-)`\n        The negative charge is shared between a secondary carbon (in the ring) and a primary carbon (exocyclic).\n\n    *   **For Option (D):** To distinguish (D) from (B), we assume the \"methyl group attached to the ring\" is located on the same allylic carbon from which the depicted H is removed. This means the depicted H is on a `-CH(CH3)-` group in the ring (e.g., at C2, which has a methyl substituent). Deprotonation of this H leads to a tertiary allylic carbanion.\n        Example structure of conjugate base (one resonance form):\n        ```\n              CH2\n             //\n            C1\n           / \\\n          C(-)(CH3) C5  (Negative charge on a tertiary ring carbon, C2)\n          |         |\n         ...-------...\n        ```\n        This carbanion is also resonance-stabilized:\n        `...-C(-)(CH3)-C1=CH2  <-->  ...-C(CH3)=C1-CH2(-)`\n        The negative charge is shared between a tertiary carbon (in the ring, bearing a methyl group) and a primary carbon (exocyclic).\n\n3.  **Comparison of Stability:**\n    *   Carbanions from (A) and (C) are not resonance-stabilized and are thus much less stable than those from (B) and (D).\n    *   Comparing carbanions from (B) and (D): Both are allylic and resonance-stabilized. The stability difference arises from the degree of substitution on the carbanionic carbon within the ring. Alkyl groups (like methyl) are electron-donating and destabilize carbanions.\n        -   The conjugate base from (B) involves a secondary carbanionic center (in one resonance form).\n        -   The conjugate base from (D) involves a tertiary carbanionic center with a methyl group directly attached to it (in one resonance form). This methyl group destabilizes the negative charge more significantly.\n    *   Therefore, the secondary allylic carbanion (from B) is more stable than the tertiary allylic carbanion (from D).\n\nSince the conjugate base of (B) is the most stable among the options, the hydrogen in (B) is the most acidic."

These are degenerate $\\pi$-type orbitals (specifically, antibonding pi orbitals).\nStatement (B) claims the HOMO of F2 is $\\sigma$-type. This is incorrect.\n\n**Statement (C): Bond energy of $O_2^+$ is smaller than the bond energy of $O_2$.**\nOxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8 ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$).\n$O_2$ has 16 electrons.

BO($O_2$) = $(10 - 6) / 2 = 2$.\n$O_2^+$ has 15 electrons (one electron is removed from $O_2$). The electron is removed from one of the highest energy orbitals, which are the antibonding $\\pi_{2p_x}^*$ or $\\pi_{2p_y}^*$ orbitals.\nMO configuration for $O_2^+$:\n$(\\sigma_{1s})^2 (\\sigma_{1s}^*)^2 (\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s}^*)^2 (\\sigma_{2p_z})^2 (\\pi_{2p_x})^2 (\\pi_{2p_y})^2 (\\pi_{2p_x}^*)^1$.\n$N_b = 10, N_a = 5$. BO($O_2^+$) = $(10 - 5) / 2 = 2.5$.\nBond energy is directly proportional to bond order. Since BO($O_2^+$) = 2.5 and BO($O_2$) = 2, the bond order of $O_2^+$ is greater than that of $O_2$.\nTherefore, the bond energy of $O_2^+$ is greater than the bond energy of $O_2$.\nStatement (C) claims that the bond energy of $O_2^+$ is smaller than that of $O_2$.

When bond orders are the same, the bond length is influenced by the size of the atoms. Lithium (Period 2, Group 1) is larger than Boron (Period 2, Group 13) because atomic radius decreases across a period.\nSince Li atoms are larger than B atoms, the bond length of Li2 is expected to be larger than that of B2.\nExperimental bond lengths: Li2 $\\approx 267$ pm, B2 $\\approx 159$ pm.\nThus, statement (D) is correct.\n\nThe question asks for the INCORRECT statement(s). Based on the analysis:\n- Statement (A) is correct.\n- Statement (B) is incorrect.\n- Statement (C) is incorrect.\n- Statement (D) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statements are (B) and (C)."

      "reasoning": "First, let's determine the structures of compounds P, Q, and R.\nThe initial reactant is cyclohexene.\n1.  **Formation of P:** Cyclohexene reacts with HBr. This is an electrophilic addition reaction.\n    Cyclohexene + HBr → Bromocyclohexane.\n    So, P is bromocyclohexane. The C-X bond here is C-Br.\n\n2.  **Formation of Q:** Compound P (bromocyclohexane) undergoes a Finkelstein reaction. The Finkelstein reaction typically involves treating an alkyl halide (chloride or bromide) with NaI in acetone to produce an alkyl iodide.\n    Bromocyclohexane + NaI (acetone) → Iodocyclohexane + NaBr.\n    So, Q is iodocyclohexane. The C-X bond here is C-I.\n\n3.  **Formation of R:** Compound P (bromocyclohexane) undergoes a Swarts reaction. The Swarts reaction involves treating an alkyl halide (chloride or bromide) with a metallic fluoride (e.g., AgF, Hg₂F₂, SbF₃) to produce an alkyl fluoride.\n    Bromocyclohexane + AgF → Fluorocyclohexane + AgBr.\n    So, R is fluorocyclohexane. The C-X bond here is C-F.\n\nSummary of compounds:\nP: Bromocyclohexane (X = Br)\nQ: Iodocyclohexane (X = I)\nR: Fluorocyclohexane (X = F)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**(A) C–X bond length in P, Q and R follows the order Q > R > P.**\nThe C-X bond length depends on the atomic radius of the halogen X. The atomic radii of halogens increase down the group: F < Cl < Br < I.\nTherefore, the bond lengths will follow the order: C-F < C-Br < C-I.\nIn terms of P, Q, R:\nBond length in R (C-F) < Bond length in P (C-Br) < Bond length in Q (C-I).\nThis can be written as Q > P > R.\nThe statement given is Q > R > P. This means C-I > C-F > C-Br.\nLet's check this:\nC-I > C-F is true (e.g., ~2.14 Å > ~1.38 Å).\nC-F > C-Br is false (e.g., ~1.38 Å is not greater than ~1.93 Å; C-F < C-Br).\nSo, statement (A) is incorrect.\n\n**(B) C–X bond enthalpy in P, Q and R follows the order R > P > Q.**\nBond enthalpy is generally inversely proportional to bond length. Shorter bonds are typically stronger and have higher bond enthalpies.\nFrom the bond length order C-F < C-Br < C-I, the bond enthalpy order should be C-F > C-Br > C-I.\nIn terms of P, Q, R:\nBond enthalpy in R (C-F) > Bond enthalpy in P (C-Br) > Bond enthalpy in Q (C-I).\nThis is R > P > Q.\nThe statement given is R > P > Q.\nThis matches our derived order.\nTypical bond energies (kJ/mol): C-F ≈ 485, C-Br ≈ 285, C-I ≈ 213.\nSo, 485 (R) > 285 (P) > 213 (Q). This is true.\nSo, statement (B) is correct.\n\n**(C) Relative reactivity toward SN2 reaction in P, Q and R follows the order P > R > Q.**\nThe reactivity in an SN2 reaction depends on the leaving group ability (assuming the alkyl part is the same, which it is here - cyclohexyl). Better leaving groups are weaker bases. The basicity of halide ions is F⁻ > Cl⁻ > Br⁻ > I⁻. Therefore, the leaving group ability is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻.\nSo, the SN2 reactivity order for alkyl halides is R'-I > R'-Br > R'-Cl > R'-F.\nIn terms of P, Q, R:\nReactivity of Q (C-I) > Reactivity of P (C-Br) > Reactivity of R (C-F).\nThis is Q > P > R.\nThe statement given is P > R > Q. This means C-Br > C-F > C-I in terms of reactivity.\nLet's check this:\nC-Br > C-F is true (Br⁻ is a better leaving group than F⁻).\nC-F > C-I is false (F⁻ is a much poorer leaving group than I⁻).\nSo, statement (C) is incorrect.\n\n**(D) pKa value of the conjugate acids of the leaving groups in P, Q and R follows the order R > Q > P.**\nThe leaving groups are:\nIn P: Br⁻. Conjugate acid is HBr.\nIn Q: I⁻. Conjugate acid is HI.\nIn R: F⁻. Conjugate acid is HF.\nWe need to compare the pKa values of HF, HI, and HBr.\nThe acidity order of hydrohalic acids is HI > HBr > HCl > HF.\nA stronger acid has a lower pKa value. So, the pKa order is pKa(HI) < pKa(HBr) < pKa(HF).\nIn terms of P, Q, R:\npKa of conjugate acid for Q (HI) < pKa of conjugate acid for P (HBr) < pKa of conjugate acid for R (HF).\nThis can be written as pKa(R) > pKa(P) > pKa(Q).\nApproximate pKa values: pKa(HF) ≈ 3.2, pKa(HBr) ≈ -9, pKa(HI) ≈ -10.\nSo, pKa(R) ≈ 3.2, pKa(P) ≈ -9, pKa(Q) ≈ -10.\nThe correct order is 3.2 (R) > -9 (P) > -10 (Q).\nThe statement given is R > Q > P. This means pKa(R) > pKa(Q) > pKa(P).\nSubstituting the values: 3.2 > -10 > -9.\nThe inequality 3.2 > -10 is true.\nThe inequality -10 > -9 is false (since -10 is less than -9).\nSo, statement (D) is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement (B) is correct."

      "reasoning": "The problem asks us to calculate the current required to produce 1 mole of Cr³⁺ ions from dichromate ions (Cr₂O₇²⁻) in an acidic medium over a period of 48.25 minutes.\n\nStep 1: Write the balanced half-reaction for the reduction of dichromate ions to Cr³⁺.\nThe dichromate ion is Cr₂O₇²⁻. It is reduced to Cr³⁺ in an acidic medium.\n1.  Balance Cr atoms:\n    Cr₂O₇²⁻ → 2Cr³⁺\n2.  Balance O atoms by adding H₂O:\n    Cr₂O₇²⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O\n3.  Balance H atoms by adding H⁺ (since it's an acidic medium):\n    Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O\n4.  Balance the charge by adding electrons (e⁻):\n    Charge on the left side = (-2) + 14*(+1) = +12\n    Charge on the right side = 2*(+3) + 7*(0) = +6\n    To balance the charge, 6 electrons must be added to the left side:\n    Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of electrons required to produce 1 mole of Cr³⁺.\nFrom the balanced half-reaction, 6 moles of electrons are required to produce 2 moles of Cr³⁺ ions.\nTherefore, to produce 1 mole of Cr³⁺ ions, the number of moles of electrons required is (6 moles e⁻ / 2 moles Cr³⁺) * 1 mole Cr³⁺ = 3 moles of electrons.\nLet n_e be the number of moles of electrons. So, n_e = 3 mol.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the change in oxidation state.\nOxidation state of Cr in Cr₂O₇²⁻: Let it be x. 2x + 7(-2) = -2 => 2x - 14 = -2 => 2x = 12 => x = +6.\nOxidation state of Cr in Cr³⁺ is +3.\nChange in oxidation state per Cr atom = +6 - (+3) = 3.\nSo, for the formation of one Cr³⁺ ion from a Cr(VI) source, 3 electrons are involved.\nCr(VI) + 3e⁻ → Cr(III)\nThus, to produce 1 mole of Cr³⁺, 3 moles of electrons are required.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total charge (Q) passed.\nThe total charge Q is given by Faraday's law: Q = n_e * F, where F is Faraday's constant.\nGiven F = 96500 C mol⁻¹.\nQ = 3 mol * 96500 C/mol\nQ = 289500 C\n\nStep 4: Convert the time (t) to seconds.\nGiven time t = 48.25 minutes.\nt = 48.25 minutes * 60 seconds/minute\nt = 2895 seconds\n\nStep 5: Calculate the current (I).\nThe relationship between charge (Q), current (I), and time (t) is Q = I * t.\nSo, I = Q / t.\nI = 289500 C / 2895 s\nI = 100 A\n\nThe current that flows through the cell is 100 amperes.\nThe question asks for a numerical value. If the value has more than two decimal places, it should be truncated/rounded to two decimal places. Since 100 is an integer, it can be written as 100 or 100.00. Given the examples in the instructions (e.g., \"If your answer is 9...\"), an integer answer can be entered as an integer.\n\nFinal check of calculations:\nMoles of electrons for 1 mole Cr³⁺ = 3.\nF = 96500 C/mol.\nQ = 3 * 96500 = 289500 C.\nTime t = 48.25 min = 48.25 * 60 s = 2895 s.\nI = Q/t = 289500 / 2895 = 100 A.\nThe calculations are correct."

The dissociation of the acid in water is:\nHA(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + A⁻(aq)\nThe acid dissociation constant is Kₐ = [H⁺][A⁻] / [HA].\n\nWater also undergoes autoionization:\nH₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\nThe ionic product of water is K𝓌 = [H⁺][OH⁻].\n\nGiven:\nInitial concentration of HA, C = 1.00 × 10⁻³ M\nKₐ = 4.00 × 10⁻¹¹\nK𝓌 = 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the H⁺ concentration assuming only the acid dissociation, neglecting water's contribution.\nIf x is the concentration of H⁺ from acid, then Kₐ = x² / (C - x).\nIf x << C, then Kₐ ≈ x² / C, so x = √(KₐC).\nx = √(4.00 × 10⁻¹¹ × 1.00 × 10⁻³) = √(4.00 × 10⁻¹⁴) = 2.00 × 10⁻⁷ M.\nThis concentration of H⁺ (2.00 × 10⁻⁷ M) is comparable to the H⁺ concentration in pure water (1.00 × 10⁻⁷ M).\nAlso, KₐC = 4.00 × 10⁻¹⁴ is comparable to K𝓌 = 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴.\nThese observations indicate that the contribution of H⁺ from water autoionization cannot be neglected.\n\nWhen considering both acid dissociation and water autoionization, the total [H⁺] is given by the solution to a more complex equation. However, for a very weak acid where water's contribution is significant, and assuming the dissociation of the acid (x) is small compared to its initial concentration (C), i.e., [HA] ≈ C, the following approximation can be used:\nThe charge balance equation is [H⁺] = [A⁻] + [OH⁻].\nFrom Kₐ = [H⁺][A⁻] / [HA], if [HA] ≈ C, then [A⁻] ≈ KₐC / [H⁺].\nFrom K𝓌 = [H⁺][OH⁻], then [OH⁻] = K𝓌 / [H⁺].\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation:\n[H⁺] = (KₐC / [H⁺]) + (K𝓌 / [H⁺])\nMultiplying by [H⁺]:\n[H⁺]² = KₐC + K𝓌\nSo, [H⁺] = √(KₐC + K𝓌)\n\nLet's check the validity of the assumption [HA] ≈ C (or x << C, where x = [A⁻]).\n[A⁻] = [H⁺] - [OH⁻] = [H⁺] - K𝓌/[H⁺].\nWe need ([H⁺] - K𝓌/[H⁺]) << C.\n\nNow, let's calculate [H⁺] using this formula:\nKₐC = (4.00 × 10⁻¹¹) × (1.00 × 10⁻³) = 4.00 × 10⁻¹⁴.\nK𝓌 = 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴.\n[H⁺] = √(4.00 × 10⁻¹⁴ + 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴)\n[H⁺] = √(5.00 × 10⁻¹⁴)\n[H⁺] = √5.00 × √(10⁻¹⁴)\n[H⁺] = √5.00 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nNow, let's verify the assumption x << C.\n[H⁺] ≈ 2.2360679 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n[OH⁻] = K𝓌 / [H⁺] = (1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (√5 × 10⁻⁷) = (1/√5) × 10⁻⁷ M ≈ 0.4472136 × 10⁻⁷ M.\nx = [A⁻] = [H⁺] - [OH⁻] = (√5 - 1/√5) × 10⁻⁷ M = ((5-1)/√5) × 10⁻⁷ M = (4/√5) × 10⁻⁷ M.\n(4/√5) ≈ 4 / 2.2360679 ≈ 1.7888544 × 10⁻⁷ M.\nSo, x ≈ 1.78885 × 10⁻⁷ M.\nThe initial concentration C = 1.00 × 10⁻³ M.\nx/C = (1.78885 × 10⁻⁷) / (1.00 × 10⁻³) = 1.78885 × 10⁻⁴.\nSince x/C = 0.000178885, which is much less than 1 (specifically, about 0.018%), the assumption [HA] ≈ C is valid.\n\nThe problem states that the concentration of H⁺ ions is X × 10⁻⁷ M.\nWe have calculated [H⁺] = √5.00 × 10⁻⁷ M.\nTherefore, X = √5.00.\n√5.00 ≈ 2.2360679...\n\nThe instruction says to \"truncate/round-off the value to TWO decimal places\". This typically means standard rounding.\nThe third decimal place in 2.2360679... is 6. Since 6 ≥ 5, we round up the second decimal place.\nSo, X ≈ 2.24.\n\nA more exact derivation involves solving the cubic equation:\n[H⁺]³ + Kₐ[H⁺]² - (KₐC + K𝓌)[H⁺] - K𝓌Kₐ = 0.\nThe approximation [H⁺] = √(KₐC + K𝓌) is equivalent to assuming that the term Kₐ in ([H⁺] + Kₐ) from the denominator of [A⁻] = KₐC / ([H⁺] + Kₐ) is negligible compared to [H⁺].\n[H⁺] ≈ 2.236 × 10⁻⁷ M and Kₐ = 4.00 × 10⁻¹¹.\nIndeed, [H⁺] >> Kₐ (2.236 × 10⁻⁷ >> 4 × 10⁻¹¹).\nSo, [H⁺] + Kₐ ≈ [H⁺], which makes [A⁻] ≈ KₐC / [H⁺]. This leads to the formula used.\nThe correction to this approximation is very small and does not affect the result when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nValue of X = √5 ≈ 2.2360679.\nRounding to two decimal places: X = 2.24."

Ideal gas behavior is to be considered.\n\n1.  **Balanced chemical equation for electrolysis of water:**\n    2 H₂O(l) → 2 H₂(g) + O₂(g)\n\n2.  **Calculate moles of water:**\n    Molar mass of H₂O = 2 × (Atomic mass of H) + 1 × (Atomic mass of O)\n    Molar mass of H₂O = 2 × 1 amu + 16 amu = 18 g/mol.\n    Number of moles of water (n_H₂O) = Mass of water / Molar mass of water\n    n_H₂O = 144 g / 18 g/mol = 8 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate moles of gaseous products:**\n    From the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n    2 moles of H₂O(l) produce 2 moles of H₂(g) and 1 mole of O₂(g).\n    So, 8 moles of H₂O(l) will produce:\n    Moles of H₂(g) = (8 mol H₂O) × (2 mol H₂ / 2 mol H₂O) = 8 mol H₂.\n    Moles of O₂(g) = (8 mol H₂O) × (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol H₂O) = 4 mol O₂.\n\n4.  **Calculate the change in moles of gas (Δn_g):**\n    Δn_g = (moles of gaseous products) - (moles of gaseous reactants).\n    The reactant, H₂O, is in the liquid phase, so moles of gaseous reactants = 0.\n    Moles of gaseous products = n_H₂ + n_O₂ = 8 mol + 4 mol = 12 mol.\n    So, Δn_g = 12 mol - 0 mol = 12 mol.\n\n5.  **Calculate expansion work done:**\n    The expansion work done by the system under constant pressure (P) is given by W = PΔV.\n    For a process involving ideal gases at constant temperature (T) and constant pressure (P), where there is a change in the number of moles of gas, PΔV = Δn_g RT.\n    Thus, W = Δn_g RT.\n    This formula assumes that the volume of liquid reactants/products is negligible compared to the volume of gaseous reactants/products. If we were to be extremely precise, W = Δn_g RT - P V_H₂O(l), where V_H₂O(l) is the volume of liquid water consumed. However, the external pressure P is not given, which implies that this P V_H₂O(l) term should be neglected (it is typically very small compared to Δn_g RT).

The carbylamine test is specific for primary amines.\n    *   Hexamethylenediamine has the structure H₂N-(CH₂)₆-NH₂.

      "reasoning": "The problem requires matching named reactions from List-I with sequences of reagents and starting materials from List-II. The interpretation is that the sequence in List-II leads to the reactant required for the named reaction in List-I.\n\n(P) **Stephen reaction**: This reaction converts nitriles (R-CN) to aldehydes (R-CHO).\n    List-II (2) starts with Benzoic acid:\n    1.  Benzoic acid + PCl₅ → Benzoyl chloride (C₆H₅COCl)\n    2.  Benzoyl chloride + NH₃ → Benzamide (C₆H₅CONH₂)\n    3.  Benzamide + P₄O₁₀, Δ → Benzonitrile (C₆H₅CN)\n    Benzonitrile is the substrate for the Stephen reaction. So, **P → 2**.\n\n(Q) **Sandmeyer reaction**: This reaction converts aryl diazonium salts (Ar-N₂⁺X⁻) to aryl halides or cyanides using Cu(I) salts.\n    List-II (3) starts with Nitrobenzene:\n    1.  Nitrobenzene + Fe, HCl → Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n    2.  Aniline + HCl, NaNO₂ (273-278 K) → Benzenediazonium chloride (C₆H₅N₂⁺Cl⁻)\n    3.  Benzenediazonium chloride + H₂O → Phenol\n    Benzenediazonium chloride, formed in step 2, is the reactant for the Sandmeyer reaction. Although step 3 shows hydrolysis to phenol, the formation of the diazonium salt is the crucial part. So, **Q → 3**.\n\n(R) **Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction**: This reaction converts primary amides (R-CONH₂) to primary amines (R-NH₂) with one less carbon.\n    List-II (4) starts with Toluene:\n    1.  Toluene + Cl₂/hv, H₂O → Benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO) (via formation of C₆H₅CHCl₂ and subsequent hydrolysis)\n    2.  Benzaldehyde + Tollen's reagent → Benzoic acid (C₆H₅COOH)\n    3.  Benzoic acid + SO₂Cl₂ → Benzoyl chloride (C₆H₅COCl)\n    4.  Benzoyl chloride + NH₃ → Benzamide (C₆H₅CONH₂)\n    Benzamide is the substrate for the Hoffmann bromamide degradation. So, **R → 4**.\n\n(S) **Cannizzaro reaction**: This reaction involves the disproportionation of an aldehyde lacking α-hydrogens in the presence of a strong base.\n    List-II (1) starts with Toluene:\n    1.  Toluene + CrO₂Cl₂/CS₂ (Etard reaction)\n    2.  H₃O⁺ (workup)\n    This sequence produces Benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO). Benzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction. So, **S → 1**.\n\nThe matches are: P→2, Q→3, R→4, S→1.\nThis corresponds to option (B)."

This implies $e^{x_0} = -x_0$.\nThe function $g(x)$ is given by $g(x) = \\frac{3xe^x + 3x - \\alpha e^x - \\alpha x}{3(e^x + 1)}$.\nWe can rewrite $g(x)$ as:\n$g(x) = \\frac{3x(e^x + 1) - \\alpha(e^x + x)}{3(e^x + 1)} = x - \\frac{\\alpha}{3} \\frac{e^x + x}{e^x + 1}$.\nThe denominator $e^x+1$ is always positive, so $g(x)$ is well-defined for all real $x$.\n\nWe need to evaluate the limit $L = \\lim_{x \\to x_0} |\\frac{g(x) + e^{x_0}}{x - x_0}|$.\nFirst, let's find $g(x_0)$:\n$g(x_0) = x_0 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3} \\frac{e^{x_0} + x_0}{e^{x_0} + 1}$.\nSince $e^{x_0} + x_0 = 0$,\n$g(x_0) = x_0 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3} \\frac{0}{e^{x_0} + 1} = x_0$.\n\nNow, let $h(x) = g(x) + e^{x_0}$.\nThen $h(x_0) = g(x_0) + e^{x_0} = x_0 + e^{x_0}$.\nSince $e^{x_0} + x_0 = 0$, we have $h(x_0) = 0$.\nThe limit can be written as $L = \\lim_{x \\to x_0} |\\frac{h(x) - h(x_0)}{x - x_0}|$.\nThis is the definition of $|h'(x_0)|$.\n$h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(g(x) + e^{x_0}) = g'(x) + 0 = g'(x)$.\nSo, $L = |g'(x_0)|$.\n\nWe need to calculate $g'(x)$:\n$g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x - \\frac{\\alpha}{3} \\frac{e^x + x}{e^x + 1} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{e^x + x}{e^x + 1} \\right)$.\nLet $k(x) = \\frac{e^x + x}{e^x + 1}$.\nUsing the quotient rule, $k'(x) = \\frac{(e^x+1)(e^x+1) - (e^x+x)e^x}{(e^x+1)^2} = \\frac{(e^x+1)^2 - e^x(e^x+x)}{(e^x+1)^2}$.\nNow, evaluate $k'(x_0)$:\n$k'(x_0) = \\frac{(e^{x_0}+1)^2 - e^{x_0}(e^{x_0}+x_0)}{(e^{x_0}+1)^2}$.\nSince $e^{x_0}+x_0=0$, the term $e^{x_0}(e^{x_0}+x_0)$ becomes $e^{x_0}(0) = 0$.\nSo, $k'(x_0) = \\frac{(e^{x_0}+1)^2}{(e^{x_0}+1)^2}$.\nWe need to ensure $e^{x_0}+1 \\neq 0$.\n$e^{x_0}+1 = -x_0+1 = 1-x_0$.\nIf $1-x_0=0$, then $x_0=1$. Substituting $x_0=1$ into $e^{x_0}+x_0=0$ gives $e^1+1=0$, or $e=-1$, which is false.\nThus, $e^{x_0}+1 \\neq 0$.\nSo, $k'(x_0) = 1$.\n\nSubstitute $k'(x_0)=1$ into the expression for $g'(x_0)$:\n$g'(x_0) = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3} (1) = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3}$.\nTherefore, $L = |g'(x_0)| = |1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3}|$.\n\nNow we check the given options:\n(A) For $\\alpha = 2$, $L = |1 - \\frac{2}{3}| = |\\frac{1}{3}| = \\frac{1}{3}$.

First, we need to find the locus $S$ of the point of intersection of the given pair of lines:\n1. $4x - 3y = 12\\alpha$\n2. $4\\alpha x + 3\\alpha y = 12$\n\nFrom equation (1), $\\alpha = \\frac{4x - 3y}{12}$.\nSince $\\alpha \\neq 0$, from equation (2), $\\alpha (4x + 3y) = 12$, so $\\alpha = \\frac{12}{4x + 3y}$.\nEquating the two expressions for $\\alpha$:\n$\\frac{4x - 3y}{12} = \\frac{12}{4x + 3y}$\n$(4x - 3y)(4x + 3y) = 12 \\times 12$\n$(4x)^2 - (3y)^2 = 144$\n$16x^2 - 9y^2 = 144$\nDividing by 144, we get the equation of the locus $S$:\n$\\frac{16x^2}{144} - \\frac{9y^2}{144} = 1$\n$\\frac{x^2}{9} - \\frac{y^2}{16} = 1$\nThis is a hyperbola with $a^2 = 9$ and $b^2 = 16$. So, $a=3, b=4$.\n\nNext, consider the tangent $T$ to $S$.\nThe tangent $T$ passes through $(p, 0)$ and $(0, q)$. The equation of line $T$ in intercept form is $\\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1$.\nThe tangent $T$ is parallel to the line $4x - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}y = 0$.\nThe slope of this line is $m = -\\frac{4}{-(3/\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nSince $T$ is parallel to this line, the slope of $T$ is also $m_T = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\n\nThe equation of a tangent to the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ with slope $m$ is $y = mx \\pm \\sqrt{a^2m^2 - b^2}$.\nHere, $a^2 = 9$, $b^2 = 16$, and $m = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\n$a^2m^2 - b^2 = 9 \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\right)^2 - 16 = 9 \\left(\\frac{16 \\times 2}{9}\\right) - 16 = 32 - 16 = 16$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{a^2m^2 - b^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$.\nThe equations of the tangents are $y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x \\pm 4$.\n\nThe tangent $T$ passes through $(0, q)$. Substituting $x=0, y=q$ into the tangent equation:\n$q = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}(0) \\pm 4 \\implies q = \\pm 4$.\nWe are given that $q > 0$, so $q = 4$.\n\nThus, the equation of the tangent $T$ is $y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x + 4$ (we choose the positive sign for the y-intercept because $q=4$ is the y-intercept).\n\nThe tangent $T$ also passes through $(p, 0)$.

So, $A = \\frac{|y_2-y_1|^3}{24(1/4)} = \\frac{|y_2-y_1|^3}{6}$.\nSubstituting $|y_2-y_1| = 2\\sqrt{h-k^2}$:\n$A = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{h-k^2})^3}{6} = \\frac{8(h-k^2)^{3/2}}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}(h-k^2)^{3/2}$.\nWe are given that the area $A = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nSo, $\\frac{4}{3}(h-k^2)^{3/2} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nThis implies $(h-k^2)^{3/2} = 1$, which leads to $h-k^2 = 1$.\nThe locus $S$ of the midpoints $(h,k)$ is $x-y^2=1$, or $x=y^2+1$.\nThe condition $h-k^2>0$ is satisfied as $h-k^2=1$.\n\nNow we check the options:\n(A) $(4, \\sqrt{3}) \\in S$?\nSubstitute $x=4, y=\\sqrt{3}$ into the equation for $S$: $x = y^2+1$.\n$4 = (\\sqrt{3})^2+1 \\Rightarrow 4 = 3+1 \\Rightarrow 4=4$. This is true. So, option (A) is correct.\n\n(B) $(5, \\sqrt{2}) \\in S$?\nSubstitute $x=5, y=\\sqrt{2}$ into $x = y^2+1$:\n$5 = (\\sqrt{2})^2+1 \\Rightarrow 5 = 2+1 \\Rightarrow 5=3$. This is false. So, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nNext, we find the area of region $R$.\n$R$ is the region in the first quadrant enclosed by the parabola $y^2=x$ (so $y=\\sqrt{x}$ for $y \\ge 0$), the curve $S: x=y^2+1$ (so $y=\\sqrt{x-1}$ for $y \\ge 0$), and the lines $x=1$ and $x=4$.\nIn the first quadrant, for $x \\in [1,4]$:\nThe curve $y=\\sqrt{x}$ defines the upper boundary of $R$.\nThe curve $y=\\sqrt{x-1}$ defines the lower boundary of $R$. (Note that for $x=1$, $y=\\sqrt{1-1}=0$, and for $x>1$, $\\sqrt{x} > \\sqrt{x-1}$).\nThe area of $R$ is given by the integral:\nArea $= \\int_1^4 (\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{x-1}) dx$.\nThe integral of $\\sqrt{x}$ is $\\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}$.\nThe integral of $\\sqrt{x-1}$ is $\\frac{2}{3}(x-1)^{3/2}$.\nSo, Area $= \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} - \\frac{2}{3}(x-1)^{3/2} \\right]_1^4$.\nEvaluating at the limits:\nUpper limit ($x=4$): $\\frac{2}{3}(4)^{3/2} - \\frac{2}{3}(4-1)^{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3}(8) - \\frac{2}{3}(3)^{3/2} = \\frac{16}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}(3\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{16}{3} - 2\\sqrt{3}$.\nLower limit ($x=1$): $\\frac{2}{3}(1)^{3/2} - \\frac{2}{3}(1-1)^{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3}(1) - \\frac{2}{3}(0)^{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3} - 0 = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nArea $= (\\frac{16}{3} - 2\\sqrt{3}) - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{16-2}{3} - 2\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n(C) Area of $R$ is $\\frac{14}{3} - 2\\sqrt{3}$. This matches the calculated area. So, option (C) is correct.\n(D) Area of $R$ is $\\frac{14}{3} - \\sqrt{3}$. This does not match the calculated area. So, option (D) is incorrect.\n\nThe correct options are (A) and (C)."

So, $\\frac{x}{x-y} = \\ln x + 1$.\nWe can express $y$ explicitly:\n$x-y = \\frac{x}{\\ln x + 1}$.\n$y = x - \\frac{x}{\\ln x + 1} = x \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\ln x + 1}\\right) = x \\left(\\frac{\\ln x + 1 - 1}{\\ln x + 1}\\right) = \\frac{x \\ln x}{\\ln x + 1}$.\n\nNow we need to find $y(e)$ and $y(e^2)$.\nFor $x=e$:\n$y(e) = \\frac{e \\ln e}{\\ln e + 1} = \\frac{e \\cdot 1}{1+1} = \\frac{e}{2}$.\nFor $x=e^2$:\n$y(e^2) = \\frac{e^2 \\ln e^2}{\\ln e^2 + 1} = \\frac{e^2 \\cdot 2}{2+1} = \\frac{2e^2}{3}$.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of $2 \\frac{(y(e))^2}{y(e^2)}$.\n$(y(e))^2 = \\left(\\frac{e}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{e^2}{4}$.\nSo, $2 \\frac{(y(e))^2}{y(e^2)} = 2 \\frac{\\frac{e^2}{4}}{\\frac{2e^2}{3}}$.\n$= 2 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2e^2}$.\nThe $e^2$ terms cancel out:\n$= 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3}{4 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nAs a decimal, $\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$.\nThe value $0.75$ has exactly two decimal places, so no truncation or rounding is needed."

The source S is at the center of the slab.\nThe distance from S to the surface of the slab (either left or right) is $t/2$.\nThe distance from the surface of the slab to the respective mirror is $(D-t)/2$.\n\nConsider the light rays from S going towards one of the mirrors, say the left mirror.\nS is at a real depth of $t/2$ from the left surface of the slab.\nThe apparent depth of S from the left surface, when viewed from the air to the left of the slab, is $d_{app} = (t/2)/n_0$.\nThe object distance for the left mirror ($u$) is the sum of the distance from the mirror to the slab surface and the apparent distance of S from the surface:\n$u = (D-t)/2 + (t/2)/n_0$.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$u = D/2 - t/2 + t/(2n_0) = D/2 - (t/2 - t/(2n_0)) = D/2 - (t/2)(1 - 1/n_0)$.\nThis is the apparent distance of S from the mirror.\n\nFor the image to be formed on S itself, we consider two main scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Rays retrace their path after reflection from one mirror.\nThis occurs if the apparent position of S is at the center of curvature (C) of the mirror. For a concave mirror, the center of curvature is at a distance $R = 2f$ from the mirror.\nSo, $u = 2f$.\n$D/2 - (t/2)(1 - 1/n_0) = 2f$.\n$D/2 = 2f + (t/2)(1 - 1/n_0)$.\n$D = 4f + t(1 - 1/n_0)$.\nThis corresponds to option (A).\n\nScenario 2: Light from S, after reflection from the first mirror (M1), becomes parallel. These parallel rays are then incident on the second mirror (M2), which focuses them back onto S.\nFor rays from S to become parallel after reflection from M1, the apparent position of S must be at the focus (F) of M1. So, $u = f$.\n$D/2 - (t/2)(1 - 1/n_0) = f$.\n$D/2 = f + (t/2)(1 - 1/n_0)$.\n$D = 2f + t(1 - 1/n_0)$.\nIf this condition holds, rays emerging from M1 are parallel to the principal axis. These parallel rays travel towards M2. When parallel rays pass through a plane slab (the entire slab of thickness $t$ is between M1 and M2 if we consider the path of these parallel rays), they emerge parallel.\nSo, parallel rays are incident on M2. M2 will focus these parallel rays at its focal point. For the final image to be formed at S, S must be the focal point of M2.\nThis means the apparent distance of S from M2 must also be $f$. Since the situation is symmetric, this leads to the same condition for $D$:\n$D = 2f + t(1 - 1/n_0)$.\nThis corresponds to option (B).\n\nOptions (C) and (D) involve the term $(n_0-1)t$. The derived effective shift term is $(t/2)(1-1/n_0)$. The term $(n_0-1)t$ is $n_0$ times $t(1-1/n_0)$. If the shift were $(t/2)(n_0-1)$, then options (C) and (D) would be derived. However, the standard formula for apparent depth leads to the shift $(t/2)(1-1/n_0)$.\nThe term $(n_0-1)t$ usually represents the change in optical path length if a thickness $t$ of air is replaced by the slab material. If we considered the total optical path length between the mirrors, $L_{opt} = (D-t) + n_0 t = D + (n_0-1)t$. If $L_{opt}$ were equal to $4f$ or $2f$, then $D = 4f - (n_0-1)t$ or $D = 2f - (n_0-1)t$. This does not match options (C) or (D) due to the sign of the term involving $t$.\n\nTherefore, based on standard principles of geometrical optics and apparent depth, options (A) and (B) are the correct conditions."

We need to find the heat absorbed (Q_XY) along path XY.\n\nFor a monatomic ideal gas, γ = C_p/C_v = (5R/2)/(3R/2) = 5/3.

This suggests Scenario 1.\n2. The question is about path XY. If the diagram is assumed to be qualitatively correct for path XY (T increases with V), then XY must be isobaric. This implies WX is adiabatic, leading to Scenario 1.\n3. If the order of processes mentioned (\"adiabatic and isobaric\") implies WX is adiabatic and XY is isobaric, this also leads to Scenario 1.\n\nBased on these considerations, Scenario 1 is the most plausible interpretation.\nThe heat absorbed along path XY is 1.6 J."

      "reasoning": "The problem asks to identify the correct reaction or reaction sequence that produces a dicarboxylic acid as the major product. Let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:**\nThe reaction is Toluene + KMnO4, OH-, heat.\nToluene is methylbenzene (C6H5-CH3). KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent. Under heating and basic conditions, it oxidizes the alkyl side chain of an alkylbenzene to a carboxylic acid group, provided there is at least one benzylic hydrogen. Toluene has three benzylic hydrogens.\nThe reaction is:\nC6H5-CH3 + [O] (from KMnO4, OH-, heat) → C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\nBenzoic acid has only one carboxylic acid group, so it is a monocarboxylic acid, not a dicarboxylic acid. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\nThe reaction is Cyclohexene + 1) O3 2) Zn, H2O.\nThis is the ozonolysis of cyclohexene followed by a reductive workup (Zn, H2O). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond.\nCyclohexene is a cyclic alkene:\n```\n  CH=CH\n /     \\\nCH2     CH2\n \\     /\n  CH2-CH2\n```\nCleavage of the double bond and reductive workup converts each carbon of the original double bond into an aldehyde group (if it had at least one hydrogen) or a ketone group (if it had no hydrogens). In cyclohexene, both carbons of the double bond are CH groups.\nSo, the reaction is:\nCyclohexene + 1) O3 2) Zn, H2O → OHC-(CH2)4-CHO (Hexane-1,6-dial or Adipaldehyde)\nHexane-1,6-dial is a dialdehyde, not a dicarboxylic acid. If the workup were oxidative (e.g., with H2O2), it would produce a dicarboxylic acid (adipic acid). However, with Zn, H2O, it's a reductive workup. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis is a two-step reaction sequence:\nStep 1: Benzene + CH3Cl, AlCl3.\nThis is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction. Benzene reacts with methyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3 (a Lewis acid catalyst) to form toluene.\nC6H6 + CH3Cl --(AlCl3)--> C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n\nStep 2: Toluene + KMnO4, OH-, heat.\nThis is the same reaction as in Option A. Toluene is oxidized to benzoic acid.\nC6H5-CH3 + [O] (from KMnO4, OH-, heat) → C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\nBenzoic acid is a monocarboxylic acid. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe reaction is Cyclohexene + KMnO4, OH-, heat.\nHot, concentrated KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent that cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds.\nFor an alkene R1R2C=CR3R4:\n- If a carbon of the double bond has one hydrogen (RCH=), it is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n- If a carbon of the double bond has two hydrogens (CH2=), it is oxidized to CO2 and H2O.\n- If a carbon of the double bond has no hydrogens (R2C=), it is oxidized to a ketone group (R2C=O).\n\nCyclohexene has a double bond where both carbons are of the type -CH= (part of the ring structure -(CH2)4-CH=CH-).\nUpon oxidative cleavage with hot KMnO4, each -CH= group is oxidized to a -COOH group. The ring opens up.\nThe reaction is:\nCyclohexene + [O] (from KMnO4, OH-, heat) → HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH (Adipic acid)\nAdipic acid (Hexane-1,6-dioic acid) is a dicarboxylic acid. Thus, option D is correct.\n\nSummary:\nOption A produces benzoic acid (monocarboxylic acid).\nOption B produces hexane-1,6-dial (dialdehyde).\nOption C produces benzoic acid (monocarboxylic acid).\nOption D produces adipic acid (dicarboxylic acid).\n\nTherefore, the correct reaction sequence that produces a dicarboxylic acid as the major product is given in Option D."

      "reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**(A) The potential energy between two point charges approaches zero more rapidly than the potential energy between a point dipole and a point charge as the distance between them approaches infinity.**\n\n*   The potential energy between two point charges q₁ and q₂ separated by a distance r is given by U_charge-charge = k * q₁ * q₂ / r. This has a 1/r dependence.\n*   The potential energy between a point charge q and a point dipole p at a distance r depends on the orientation of the dipole. The electric field E_dipole due to a dipole p falls off as 1/r³ at large distances. The potential V_dipole due to the dipole falls off as 1/r² (since E = -∇V). The potential energy of a point charge q in this potential is U_dipole-charge = q * V_dipole, so U_dipole-charge is proportional to 1/r².\n*   We are comparing how 1/r and 1/r² approach zero as r → ∞.\n    Since r² grows faster than r, 1/r² approaches zero more rapidly than 1/r.\n    Therefore, the potential energy between a point dipole and a point charge (1/r²) approaches zero more rapidly than the potential energy between two point charges (1/r).\n*   The statement says that the potential energy between two point charges (1/r) approaches zero more rapidly than the potential energy between a point dipole and a point charge (1/r²). This is false.\n\n**(B) The average potential energy of two rotating polar molecules that are separated by a distance r has 1/r³ dependence.**\n\n*   This refers to the dipole-dipole interaction between two polar molecules that are free to rotate.\n*   The instantaneous potential energy between two dipoles p₁ and p₂ has a 1/r³ dependence and also depends on their relative orientation: U(r, angles) ∝ p₁p₂/r³.\n*   However, when these molecules are rotating, their orientations are influenced by thermal energy (kT). The \"average potential energy\" refers to the thermally averaged interaction energy, also known as the Keesom interaction.\n*   The Keesom interaction energy is given by <U(r)>_Keesom = - (2/3) * (p₁²p₂² / ((4πε₀)²kT * r⁶)).\n*   This average potential energy has a 1/r⁶ dependence and also depends on temperature (1/T).\n*   Therefore, the statement that the average potential energy has a 1/r³ dependence is false. The 1/r³ dependence applies to fixed dipoles or the instantaneous potential before thermal averaging.\n\n**(C) The dipole-induced dipole average interaction energy is independent of temperature.**\n\n*   This refers to the Debye interaction. A permanent dipole in one molecule induces a dipole in a neighboring (polar or nonpolar) molecule.\n*   Let molecule 1 have a permanent dipole p₁ and molecule 2 have polarizability α₂. The electric field E₁ due to p₁ induces a dipole p₂_induced = α₂E₁ in molecule 2.\n*   The interaction energy is U = -1/2 α₂ <E₁²>, where <E₁²> is the mean square electric field produced by the rotating dipole p₁ averaged over its orientations.\n*   The mean square electric field <E₁²> from a rotating dipole p₁ at a distance r is proportional to p₁²/r⁶. Specifically, <E₁²> = 2p₁²/((4πε₀)²r⁶).\n*   So, the average dipole-induced dipole interaction energy is <U(r)>_Debye = -1/2 α₂ * (2p₁²/((4πε₀)²r⁶)) = - p₁²α₂ / ((4πε₀)²r⁶).\n*   This expression does not contain temperature T. Therefore, the dipole-induced dipole average interaction energy is independent of temperature.\n*   This statement is true.\n\n**(D) Nonpolar molecules attract one another even though neither has a permanent dipole moment.**\n\n*   This statement describes London dispersion forces (also known as instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces).\n*   In nonpolar molecules, the electron distribution can fluctuate, creating temporary, instantaneous dipole moments.\n*   An instantaneous dipole in one molecule can induce a dipole in a neighboring molecule.\n*   The interaction between these instantaneous and induced dipoles results in a net attractive force.\n*   These forces are present between all molecules, but they are the *only* attractive forces between nonpolar molecules, explaining why nonpolar substances can condense.\n*   This statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Statement (A) is False.\n*   Statement (B) is False.\n*   Statement (C) is True.\n*   Statement (D) is True.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are (C) and (D)."

Cyanide (CN⁻) has a charge of -1.\n    y + 6(-1) = -3\n    y - 6 = -3\n    y = +3\n    So, Mn is in the +3 oxidation state (Mn³⁺).\n\n2.  **Electronic configuration of Mn³⁺:**\n    As before, Mn³⁺ is [Ar] 3d⁴.\n\n3.  **Ligand field and spin state:**\n    CN⁻ is a strong-field ligand (it is high in the spectrochemical series).\n    For a d⁴ ion in an octahedral complex with strong-field ligands, the complex will be low-spin. This means electrons will pair up in the lower energy t₂g orbitals before occupying higher energy e_g orbitals.\n    The electronic configuration for low-spin d⁴ in an octahedral field is t₂g⁴ e_g⁰.\n\n4.  **Number of unpaired electrons (n₂):**\n    In the t₂g⁴ configuration, the four electrons are distributed in the three t₂g orbitals. According to Hund's rule and Pauli exclusion principle, two electrons will be paired in one t₂g orbital, and the other two electrons will occupy the remaining two t₂g orbitals singly with parallel spins (e.g., (d_xy)² (d_yz)¹ (d_zx)¹).\n    So, n₂ = 2 unpaired electrons.\n\n5.  **Spin-only magnetic moment (µ₂):**\n    µ₂ = √[2(2+2)] = √[2 × 4] = √8 B.M.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the sum of the magnetic moments**\nThe sum S = µ₁ + µ₂ = √24 + √8.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the numerical values:\n√24 = √(4 × 6) = 2√6. Since √6 ≈ 2.44948974, then √24 ≈ 2 × 2.44948974 ≈ 4.89897948 B.M.\n√8 = √(4 × 2) = 2√2. Since √2 ≈ 1.41421356, then √8 ≈ 2 × 1.41421356 ≈ 2.82842712 B.M.\n\nSum S ≈ 4.89897948 + 2.82842712\nS ≈ 7.7274066 B.M.\n\n**Step 4: Round to two decimal places**\nThe instruction states: \"If the numerical value has more than two decimal places, truncate/round-off the value to TWO decimal places.\"\nStandard practice is to round-off.\nThe value is 7.7274066...\nThe third decimal place is 7. Since 7 ≥ 5, we round up the second decimal place.\nSo, 7.72 becomes 7.73.\n\nSum ≈ 7.73 B.M."

      "reasoning": "1.  Determine the total molar mass of the 8 individual monosaccharide units produced upon complete hydrolysis.\n    A linear octasaccharide has 8 monosaccharide units and 7 glycosidic bonds. Formation of these bonds involves the elimination of 7 water molecules.\n    Molar mass of octasaccharide (M_octa) = 1024 g/mol.\n    Molar mass of water (M_water) = 18 g/mol.\n    Total molar mass of hydrolyzed monosaccharides (M_mono_sum) = M_octa + 7 * M_water\n    M_mono_sum = 1024 + 7 * 18 = 1024 + 126 = 1150 g/mol.\n\n2.  Define variables for the number of each type of monosaccharide unit:\n    Let `x` = number of ribose units (M_ribose = 150 g/mol).\n    Let `y` = number of 2-deoxyribose units (M_2-deoxyribose = 134 g/mol).\n    Let `z` = number of glucose units (M_glucose = 180 g/mol).\n\n3.  Set up equations based on the given information:\n    Equation (i): Total number of units: `x + y + z = 8`.\n    Equation (ii): Total mass of hydrolyzed monosaccharides: `150x + 134y + 180z = 1150`.\n    Equation (iii): Mass percentage of 2-deoxyribose:\n    The mass of 2-deoxyribose formed is `134y`.\n    The total mass of monosaccharides produced is `1150`.\n    So, `(134y) / 1150 = 0.5826`.\n\n4.  Solve for `y` using Equation (iii):\n    `134y = 0.5826 * 1150`\n    `134y = 669.99`\n    `y = 669.99 / 134 = 4.999925...`\n    Since `y` must be an integer (number of units), `y = 5`.\n\n5.  Substitute `y = 5` into Equations (i) and (ii):\n    From Equation (i): `x + 5 + z = 8` => `x + z = 3` (Equation iv).\n    From Equation (ii): `150x + 134(5) + 180z = 1150`\n    `150x + 670 + 180z = 1150`\n    `150x + 180z = 1150 - 670`\n    `150x + 180z = 480`\n    Divide by 30: `5x + 6z = 16` (Equation v).\n\n6.  Solve the system of linear equations (iv) and (v) for `x` and `z`:\n    From Equation (iv), `z = 3 - x`.\n    Substitute this into Equation (v):\n    `5x + 6(3 - x) = 16`\n    `5x + 18 - 6x = 16`\n    `-x + 18 = 16`\n    `-x = 16 - 18`\n    `-x = -2`\n    `x = 2`.\n\n7.  The number of ribose units is `x`.\n    Therefore, the number of ribose unit(s) present in one molecule of octasaccharide is 2.\n    (We can also find `z = 3 - x = 3 - 2 = 1`).\n    The composition is 2 ribose, 5 2-deoxyribose, and 1 glucose."
