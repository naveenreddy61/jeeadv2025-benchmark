The coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\(h(x)\\) is the difference of the coefficients of \\(x^3\\) in \\(f(x+1)\\) and \\(g(x+2)\\):\n\nCoefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\(h(x)\\) = \\((a_3 + 4) - (b_3 + 8) = a_3 - b_3 - 4\\).\n\nWe are given the condition that \\(f(x) \neq g(x)\\) for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\nLet \\(P(x) = f(x) - g(x)\\).\n\n\n\nSo, \\(P(x) = (a_3 - b_3)x^3 + (a_2 - b_2)x^2 + 7x + (a_1 - b_1)\\).\n\nThe condition \\(f(x) \neq g(x)\\) for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) means that \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots.\n\nConsider the degree of the polynomial \\(P(x)\\):\n1. If \\(a_3 - b_3 \neq 0\\), then \\(P(x)\\) is a cubic polynomial (degree 3). A polynomial of odd degree (like 3) must have at least one real root. This contradicts the condition that \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots.\n   Therefore, \\(a_3 - b_3\\) must be 0.\n\n2. If \\(a_3 - b_3 = 0\\), then \\(P(x) = (a_2 - b_2)x^2 + 7x + (a_1 - b_1)\\).\n   a. If \\(a_2 - b_2 = 0\\), then \\(P(x) = 7x + (a_1 - b_1)\\). This is a linear polynomial (degree 1). A linear polynomial always has exactly one real root (\\(x = -(a_1 - b_1)/7\\)). This contradicts the condition that \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots.\n      Therefore, \\(a_2 - b_2\\) must be non-zero.\n   b. If \\(a_2 - b_2 \neq 0\\), then \\(P(x)\\) is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). For a quadratic polynomial to have no real roots, its discriminant must be negative. The discriminant of \\(Ax^2 + Bx + C\\) is \\(B^2 - 4AC\\). In this case, \\(A = a_2 - b_2\\), \\(B = 7\\), \\(C = a_1 - b_1\\). So, we must have \\(7^2 - 4(a_2 - b_2)(a_1 - b_1) < 0\\). This is a possible scenario (e.g., if \\(a_2 - b_2 = 1\\) and \\(a_1 - b_1 = 100\\), then \\(P(x) = x^2 + 7x + 100\\), and its discriminant is \\(49 - 400 = -351 < 0\\)).\n\nFrom the analysis, the only way for \\(P(x)\\) to have no real roots is if its degree is an even number, and specifically, it must be a quadratic with a negative discriminant.

Since $-1 \\le \\sin{\\frac{1}{h}} \\le 1$, we have $-|h| \\le h \\sin{\\frac{1}{h}} \\le |h|$. As $h \\to 0$, $|h| \\to 0$, so by the Squeeze Theorem, $\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h \\sin{\\frac{1}{h}}) = 0$.\nTherefore, $f'(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$.

For any given $\\delta > 0$, we can choose $n$ large enough such that $x_n \\in (0, \\delta)$.\nAt these points, $\\cos{\\frac{1}{x_n}} = \\cos(2n\\pi) = 1$ and $\\sin{\\frac{1}{x_n}} = \\sin(2n\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, $f'(x_n) = -x_n(4 + 2 \\cdot 0) + 1 = -4x_n + 1$.\nSubstituting $x_n = \\frac{1}{2n\\pi}$, we get $f'(x_n) = -4\\left(\\frac{1}{2n\\pi}\\right) + 1 = 1 - \\frac{2}{n\\pi}$.\nFor any $n \\ge 1$, $1 - \\frac{2}{n\\pi}$ is positive (e.g., for $n=1$, $1 - \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\approx 1 - 0.636 = 0.364 > 0$).\nSince we can find points $x_n$ arbitrarily close to 0 (on the positive side) where $f'(x_n) > 0$, the function $f$ is not decreasing on any interval $(0, \\delta)$.\nThus, statement (B) is FALSE.\n\n**Option (C): For any positive real number $\\delta$, the function $f$ is NOT an increasing function on the interval $(-\\delta, 0)$.**\nThis statement means that for any $\\delta > 0$, there exists some $x_0 \\in (-\\delta, 0)$ such that $f'(x_0) < 0$.\nLet's use $f'(x) = -x(4 + 2 \\sin{\\frac{1}{x}}) + \\cos{\\frac{1}{x}}$.\nConsider $x < 0$ and $x$ close to 0.

This means $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix. Since $Q$ has integer entries, its determinant must be an integer. For an orthogonal matrix, $\\det(Q)^2 = \\det(Q Q^T) = \\det(I) = 1$, so $\\det(Q) = \\pm 1$. This also implies that $Q$ is invertible.\n\nNext, let's analyze the condition $PQ = QP$. This means $Q$ commutes with $P$.\nThe matrix $P$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 2 (multiplicity 2) and 3 (multiplicity 1). The eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 2 is $E_2 = \\text{span}\\{(1,0,0)^T, (0,1,0)^T\\}$, which is the $xy$-plane. The eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 3 is $E_3 = \\text{span}\\{(0,0,1)^T\\}$, which is the $z$-axis.\nIf $Q$ commutes with $P$, then $Q$ must map each eigenspace of $P$ to itself. That is, $Q(E_2) = E_2$ and $Q(E_3) = E_3$.\nThis implies that $Q$ must be a block diagonal matrix of the form:\n$Q = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & 0 \\\\ d & e & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & i \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we combine this form of $Q$ with the orthogonality condition $Q Q^T = I$.\n$Q Q^T = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & 0 \\\\ d & e & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & i \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & d & 0 \\\\ b & e & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & i \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2+b^2 & ad+be & 0 \\\\ ad+be & d^2+e^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & i^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nEquating this to the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, we get the following system of equations:\n1. $a^2+b^2 = 1$\n2. $ad+be = 0$\n3. $d^2+e^2 = 1$\n4. $i^2 = 1$\n\nSince $Q$ has integer entries, $a, b, d, e, i$ must be integers.\n\nFrom equation (4), $i^2 = 1$. Since $i$ is an integer, $i$ can be $1$ or $-1$. There are 2 possibilities for $i$.\n\nNow consider the $2 \\times 2$ submatrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ d & e \\end{pmatrix}$. Equations (1), (2), and (3) imply that $M M^T = I_2$, meaning $M$ is a $2 \\times 2$ orthogonal matrix with integer entries.\nFor an integer vector to have length 1, its components must be $(\\pm 1, 0)$ or $(0, \\pm 1)$.\nLet the rows of $M$ be $R_1 = (a, b)$ and $R_2 = (d, e)$.\n$R_1$ must be one of the 4 unit integer vectors: $(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)$.\n$R_2$ must be orthogonal to $R_1$ and also be one of the 4 unit integer vectors.\n\nLet's list the possibilities for $M$:\n- If $R_1 = (1, 0)$, then $R_2$ must be orthogonal to $(1,0)$ and be a unit integer vector. So $R_2$ can be $(0, 1)$ or $(0, -1)$. This gives 2 matrices: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- If $R_1 = (-1, 0)$, then $R_2$ must be $(0, 1)$ or $(0, -1)$. This gives 2 matrices: $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- If $R_1 = (0, 1)$, then $R_2$ must be $(1, 0)$ or $(-1, 0)$.

      "reasoning": "First, we need to find the direction vector of line L₁. L₁ is the intersection of the planes 2x + 3y + z = 4 and x + 2y + z = 5. The direction vector of L₁ is perpendicular to the normal vectors of both planes. The normal vector of the first plane is n₁ = (2, 3, 1) and for the second plane is n₂ = (1, 2, 1).\nThe direction vector v of L₁ is n₁ × n₂:\nv = (2, 3, 1) × (1, 2, 1) = (3*1 - 1*2, 1*1 - 2*1, 2*2 - 3*1) = (1, -1, 1).\n\nLine L₂ passes through P(2, -1, 3) and is parallel to L₁. So, the direction vector of L₂ is also v = (1, -1, 1).\nThe parametric equation of L₂ is: x = 2 + t, y = -1 - t, z = 3 + t.\n\nNext, we find the point Q, where L₂ meets the plane M (2x + y - 2z = 6).\nSubstitute the parametric equations of L₂ into the equation of plane M:\n2(2 + t) + (-1 - t) - 2(3 + t) = 6\n4 + 2t - 1 - t - 6 - 2t = 6\n-3 - t = 6\nt = -9\nNow, substitute t = -9 back into the parametric equations of L₂ to find Q:\nQx = 2 + (-9) = -7\nQy = -1 - (-9) = 8\nQz = 3 + (-9) = -6\nSo, Q = (-7, 8, -6).\n\nNow, let's find the point R, which is the foot of the perpendicular drawn from P(2, -1, 3) to the plane M (2x + y - 2z = 6).\nThe line PR is perpendicular to plane M, so its direction vector is the normal vector of M, n_M = (2, 1, -2).\nThe parametric equation of line PR is: x = 2 + 2s, y = -1 + s, z = 3 - 2s.\nSubstitute these into the equation of plane M:\n2(2 + 2s) + (-1 + s) - 2(3 - 2s) = 6\n4 + 4s - 1 + s - 6 + 4s = 6\n-3 + 9s = 6\n9s = 9\ns = 1\nNow, substitute s = 1 back into the parametric equations of PR to find R:\nRx = 2 + 2(1) = 4\nRy = -1 + 1 = 0\nRz = 3 - 2(1) = 1\nSo, R = (4, 0, 1).\n\nNow we can evaluate the given statements:\n\n**(A) The length of the line segment PQ is 9√3**\nP = (2, -1, 3), Q = (-7, 8, -6)\nVector PQ = Q - P = (-7 - 2, 8 - (-1), -6 - 3) = (-9, 9, -9)\nLength |PQ| = √((-9)² + 9² + (-9)²) = √(81 + 81 + 81) = √(3 * 81) = 9√3.\nStatement (A) is TRUE.\n\n**(B) The length of the line segment QR is 15**\nQ = (-7, 8, -6), R = (4, 0, 1)\nVector QR = R - Q = (4 - (-7), 0 - 8, 1 - (-6)) = (11, -8, 7)\nLength |QR| = √(11² + (-8)² + 7²) = √(121 + 64 + 49) = √234.\nSince √234 ≠ 15 (15² = 225), statement (B) is FALSE.\n\n**(C) The area of ΔPQR is (3/2)√234**\nSince R is the foot of the perpendicular from P to plane M, the line segment PR is perpendicular to the plane M.

      "reasoning": "The problem involves a functional equation and properties of arithmetic and geometric progressions.\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional equation:**\n    The given functional equation is $f(x + y) = f(x)f(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    This is a characteristic functional equation for exponential functions.\n    -   Let $x=0, y=0$. Then $f(0) = f(0)f(0)$. Since $f(0) > 0$, we can divide by $f(0)$, which gives $f(0) = 1$.\n    -   For any integer $n$, $f(nx) = (f(x))^n$.\n    -   Let $x=1$. Then $f(n) = (f(1))^n$. Let $f(1) = c$. Since $f(x) > 0$, $c$ must be positive ($c > 0$).\n    -   It can be shown that $f(x) = c^x$ for all rational $x$. Assuming continuity (which is generally implied in such problems unless stated otherwise, or can be derived from $f(x)>0$), this extends to all real $x$. So, $f(x) = c^x$ for some constant $c > 0$.\n\n2.  **Relate the arithmetic progression to the function values:**\n    The real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{50}$ are in an arithmetic progression (AP). Let the first term be $A$ and the common difference be $D$. So, $a_i = A + (i-1)D$.\n    Now, let's look at the terms $f(a_i)$:\n    $f(a_i) = c^{a_i} = c^{A + (i-1)D} = c^A \\cdot c^{(i-1)D} = c^A \\cdot (c^D)^{i-1}$.\n    This shows that the sequence $f(a_1), f(a_2), ..., f(a_{50})$ forms a geometric progression (GP) with:\n    -   First term: $X = f(a_1) = c^A$\n    -   Common ratio: $r = c^D$\n\n3.  **Use the first given condition to find the common ratio:**\n    The first condition is $f(a_{31}) = 64f(a_{25})$.\n    Using the GP terms: $f(a_1)r^{30} = 64 f(a_1)r^{24}$.\n    Since $f(a_1) = c^A > 0$, we can divide both sides by $f(a_1)$:\n    $r^{30} = 64 r^{24}$\n    $r^6 = 64$.\n    Since $r = c^D$ and $c>0$, $r$ must be positive. Therefore, $r = \\sqrt[6]{64} = 2$.\n    So, the common ratio of the GP $f(a_i)$ is $r=2$.\n\n4.  **Use the second given condition to find the first term of the GP:**\n    The second condition is $\\sum_{i=1}^{50} f(a_i) = 3(2^{25} + 1)$.\n    This is the sum of the first 50 terms of the GP. The sum of a GP is $S_n = \\frac{X(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}$.\n    Here, $X = f(a_1)$, $r=2$, and $n=50$.\n    $\\sum_{i=1}^{50} f(a_i) = f(a_1) \\frac{2^{50} - 1}{2 - 1} = f(a_1)(2^{50} - 1)$.\n    Equating this to the given value:\n    $f(a_1)(2^{50} - 1) = 3(2^{25} + 1)$.\n    We can factor $2^{50} - 1$ using the difference of squares formula, $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$:\n    $2^{50} - 1 = (2^{25})^2 - 1^2 = (2^{25} - 1)(2^{25} + 1)$.\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    $f(a_1)(2^{25} - 1)(2^{25} + 1) = 3(2^{25} + 1)$.\n    Since $2^{25} + 1 \\ne 0$, we can divide both sides by $(2^{25} + 1)$:\n    $f(a_1)(2^{25} - 1) = 3$.\n    Therefore, $f(a_1) = \\frac{3}{2^{25} - 1}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the required sum:**\n    We need to find the value of $\\sum_{i=6}^{30} f(a_i)$.\n    This is a sum of terms from the GP, starting from $f(a_6)$ up to $f(a_{30})$.\n    The number of terms in this sum is $30 - 6 + 1 = 25$.\n    The first term of this sub-sum is $f(a_6)$. In terms of $f(a_1)$ and $r$:\n    $f(a_6) = f(a_1) \\cdot r^{6-1} = f(a_1) \\cdot r^5$.\n    Since $r=2$, $f(a_6) = f(a_1) \\cdot 2^5$.\n    Now, use the GP sum formula for these 25 terms, with first term $f(a_6)$ and common ratio $r=2$:\n    $\\sum_{i=6}^{30} f(a_i) = f(a_6) \\frac{r^{25} - 1}{r - 1}$.\n    Substitute $f(a_6) = f(a_1) \\cdot 2^5$ and $r=2$:\n    $\\sum_{i=6}^{30} f(a_i) = (f(a_1) \\cdot 2^5) \\frac{2^{25} - 1}{2 - 1}$.\n    $\\sum_{i=6}^{30} f(a_i) = f(a_1) \\cdot 2^5 \\cdot (2^{25} - 1)$.\n    Now substitute the value of $f(a_1) = \\frac{3}{2^{25} - 1}$:\n    $\\sum_{i=6}^{30} f(a_i) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{25} - 1}\\right) \\cdot 2^5 \\cdot (2^{25} - 1)$.\n    The term $(2^{25} - 1)$ cancels out:\n    $\\sum_{i=6}^{30} f(a_i) = 3 \\cdot 2^5$.\n    Calculate $2^5 = 32$.\n    $\\sum_{i=6}^{30} f(a_i) = 3 \\cdot 32 = 96$.\n\nThe final numerical value is 96."

For $y_1(x)$: $\\frac{dy_1}{dx} - (\\sin x)^2 y_1 = 0$\n    This is a separable differential equation: $\\frac{dy_1}{y_1} = \\sin^2 x dx$\n    Integrating both sides: $\\int \\frac{dy_1}{y_1} = \\int \\frac{1 - \\cos(2x)}{2} dx$\n    $\\ln|y_1| = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4} + C_1$\n    $y_1(x) = A_1 e^{\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4}}$\n    Using the initial condition $y_1(1) = 5$: $5 = A_1 e^{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2)}{4}}$.\n\n2.

For $y_3(x)$: $\\frac{dy_3}{dx} - (\\frac{2-x^3}{x^3}) y_3 = 0$\n    This is a separable differential equation: $\\frac{dy_3}{y_3} = (\\frac{2}{x^3} - 1) dx$\n    Integrating both sides: $\\int \\frac{dy_3}{y_3} = \\int (2x^{-3} - 1) dx$\n    $\\ln|y_3| = 2\\frac{x^{-2}}{-2} - x + C_3$\n    $\\ln|y_3| = -\\frac{1}{x^2} - x + C_3$\n    $y_3(x) = A_3 e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2} - x}$\n    Using the initial condition $y_3(1) = \\frac{3}{5e}$: $\\frac{3}{5e} = A_3 e^{-\\frac{1}{1^2} - 1} = A_3 e^{-2}$.\n    So, $A_3 = \\frac{3}{5e} e^2 = \\frac{3e}{5}$.\n\nNext, let's find the product $P(x) = y_1(x)y_2(x)y_3(x)$:\n$P(x) = \\left( A_1 e^{\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4}} \right) \\left( A_2 e^{\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4}} \right) \\left( A_3 e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2} - x} \right)$\n$P(x) = (A_1 A_2 A_3) e^{\\left(\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4}\right) + \\left(\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4}\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{x^2} - x\right)}$\n$P(x) = (A_1 A_2 A_3) e^{x - \\frac{1}{x^2} - x}$\n$P(x) = (A_1 A_2 A_3) e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}$\n\nNow, let's calculate the product of the constants $A_1 A_2 A_3$:\nFrom the initial conditions:\n$A_1 = 5 e^{-(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2)}{4})}$\n$A_2 = \\frac{1}{3} e^{-(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2)}{4})}$\n$A_3 = \\frac{3e}{5}$\n\n$A_1 A_2 A_3 = \\left( 5 e^{-(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2)}{4})} \right) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} e^{-(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2)}{4})} \right) \\left( \\frac{3e}{5} \right)$\n$A_1 A_2 A_3 = \\left( 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3e}{5} \right) e^{-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2)}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2)}{4}}$\n$A_1 A_2 A_3 = e \\cdot e^{-1} = e^0 = 1$.\n\nSo, $P(x) = y_1(x)y_2(x)y_3(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}$.\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate the limit:\n$L = \\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{y_1(x)y_2(x)y_3(x) + 2x}{e^{3x} \\sin x} = \\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} + 2x}{e^{3x} \\sin x}$\n\nAs $x \to 0^+$:\n-   $e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}$: As $x \to 0^+$, $\\frac{1}{x^2} \to \\infty$, so $e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} \to e^{-\\infty} = 0$.\n-   $2x \to 0$.\n-   $e^{3x} \to e^0 = 1$.\n-   $\\sin x \to 0$.\n\nThe limit is of the indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$. We can use the property that $e^{-1/x^2}$ approaches zero faster than any positive power of $x$ (or $1/x^n$ approaches infinity). Specifically, $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{e^{-1/x^2}}{x^n} = 0$ for any $n > 0$.\n\nDivide the numerator and denominator by $x$:\n$L = \\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}}{x} + \\frac{2x}{x}}{\\frac{e^{3x} \\sin x}{x}}$\n$L = \\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}}{x} + 2}{e^{3x} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}}$\n\nNow, evaluate each part of the limit:\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}}}{x}$: Let $t = 1/x$. As $x \to 0^+$, $t \to \\infty$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{t\to \\infty} \\frac{e^{-t^2}}{1/t} = \\lim_{t\to \\infty} \\frac{t}{e^{t^2}}$. Since $e^{t^2}$ grows much faster than $t$, this limit is $0$.\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} 2 = 2$.\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} e^{3x} = e^0 = 1$.\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1$.\n\nSubstitute these values back into the limit expression:\n$L = \\frac{0 + 2}{1 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\nAlternatively, using L'Hopital's Rule:\nLet $N(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} + 2x$ and $D(x) = e^{3x} \\sin x$.\n$N'(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(-\\frac{1}{x^2}) + 2 = e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{x^3} + 2$\n$D'(x) = 3e^{3x} \\sin x + e^{3x} \\cos x$\n\n$L = \\lim_{x\to 0^+} \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} \\frac{2}{x^3} + 2}{3e^{3x} \\sin x + e^{3x} \\cos x}$\n\nEvaluate the terms as $x \to 0^+$:\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} \\frac{2}{x^3}$: Let $t = 1/x$. As $x \to 0^+$, $t \to \\infty$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{t\to \\infty} e^{-t^2} \\cdot 2t^3 = \\lim_{t\to \\infty} \\frac{2t^3}{e^{t^2}}$. This limit is $0$ because $e^{t^2}$ grows much faster than $t^3$.\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} 2 = 2$.\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} 3e^{3x} \\sin x = 3e^0 \\sin 0 = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n-   $\\lim_{x\to 0^+} e^{3x} \\cos x = e^0 \\cos 0 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, $L = \\frac{0 + 2}{0 + 1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result."

Since $h(x)$ is strictly decreasing on $(1,2)$, $h(x)/n$ is also strictly decreasing and thus not constant. Therefore, the interval $[55/n, 60/n]$ must not contain any integer.\nLet's test the values of $n$ from List-II:\n- If $n=8$: $[55/8, 60/8] = [6.875, 7.5]$. This interval contains the integer 7. So $f(x)$ is discontinuous.\n- If $n=9$: $[55/9, 60/9] = [6.11..., 6.66...]$. This interval does not contain any integer. So $f(x)$ is continuous.\n- If $n=5$: $[55/5, 60/5] = [11, 12]$. This interval contains integers 11 and 12. So $f(x)$ is discontinuous.\n- If $n=6$: $[55/6, 60/6] = [9.16..., 10]$. This interval contains the integer 10.

Since $n$ is a natural number, $Q(3) > 0$.\nNow, let's find the first derivative $h'(x)$:\n$h'(x) = n(x-3)^{n-1} Q(x) + (x-3)^n Q'(x) = (x-3)^{n-1} [n Q(x) + (x-3) Q'(x)]$.\nLet $R(x) = n Q(x) + (x-3) Q'(x)$.\nAt $x=3$, $R(3) = n Q(3) + (3-3) Q'(3) = n Q(3) = n \\cdot 18 \\cdot 6^n$. Since $n > 5$, $R(3) > 0$.\nThe sign of $h'(x)$ around $x=3$ is determined by the sign of $(x-3)^{n-1}$.\nFor $x=3$ to be a local minimum, $h'(x)$ must change sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through 3.\nThis requires $(x-3)^{n-1}$ to change sign from negative to positive. This happens if and only if the exponent $n-1$ is an odd integer.\nIf $n-1$ is an odd integer, then $n$ must be an even integer.\nWe are looking for the smallest natural number $n$ which is greater than 5. The natural numbers greater than 5 are $6, 7, 8, \\dots$.\nThe smallest even integer in this set is $n=6$.\nIf $n=6$, then $n-1=5$ (odd).\n- For $x < 3$ (and close to 3), $(x-3)^5 < 0$. Since $R(3) > 0$, $R(x)$ is positive near $x=3$. So $h'(x) < 0$.\n- For $x > 3$ (and close to 3), $(x-3)^5 > 0$. Since $R(3) > 0$, $R(x)$ is positive near $x=3$. So $h'(x) > 0$.\nSince $h'(x)$ changes from negative to positive at $x=3$, $x=3$ is a local minimum.\nSo (R) → (4).\n\n**Part (S):** Number of $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $l(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} (\\sin|x - k| + \\cos|x - k + \\frac{1}{2}|)$, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, is NOT differentiable at $x_0$.\nLet's analyze the differentiability of $\\sin|u|$ and $\\cos|u|$ at $u=0$.\n- For $f(u) = \\sin|u|$:\n  Left derivative at $u=0$: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{\\sin|h| - \\sin|0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{\\sin(-h)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{-\\sin h}{h} = -1$.\n  Right derivative at $u=0$: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\sin|h| - \\sin|0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\sin h}{h} = 1$.\n  Since $-1 \\ne 1$, $\\sin|u|$ is NOT differentiable at $u=0$.\n- For $g(u) = \\cos|u|$:\n  Left derivative at $u=0$: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{\\cos|h| - \\cos|0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{\\cos(-h) - 1}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{\\cos h - 1}{h} = 0$.\n  Right derivative at $u=0$: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\cos|h| - \\cos|0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\cos h - 1}{h} = 0$.\n  Since $0 = 0$, $\\cos|u|$ IS differentiable at $u=0$.\n\nNow consider $l(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} (\\sin|x - k| + \\cos|x - k + \\frac{1}{2}|)$.\n- The terms $\\sin|x-k|$ are not differentiable when $x-k=0$, i.e., at $x=k$. For $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$, these points are $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n- The terms $\\cos|x-k+1/2|$ are differentiable everywhere, including when $x-k+1/2=0$.\n\nFor $l(x)$ to be not differentiable at $x_0$, at least one of its component functions must be not differentiable at $x_0$, and this non-differentiability must not be cancelled out by other terms. Since the non-differentiable points for $\\sin|x-k|$ are distinct from each other and from any points where $\\cos|x-k+1/2|$ might cause issues (which it doesn't), the points of non-differentiability for $l(x)$ are precisely where $\\sin|x-k|$ is not differentiable.\nThese points are $x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\nThere are 5 such distinct points.\nSo (S) → (3).\n\n**Summary of matches:**\n(P) → (2)\n(Q) → (1)\n(R) → (4)\n(S) → (3)\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n(A) (P)→(1) (Q)→(3) (R) → (2) (S) → (5)\n(B) (P)→(2) (Q) → (1) (R)→(4) (S) → (3)\n(C) (P)→(5) (Q) → (1) (R)→(4) (S)→(3)\n(D) (P)→(2) (Q)→(3) (R)→(1) (S) → (5)\n\nThe correct option is (B)."

So, the final velocity of $M_1$ in the CM frame, $v_1'$, has the same magnitude as $u_1'$:\n    $v_1' = u_1' = \\frac{1}{3} u_1$.\n\n3.  **Relationship between Lab Frame and CM Frame Velocities:**\n    The final velocity of the heavier particle in the lab frame, $\\vec{v_1}$, is the vector sum of its final velocity in the CM frame, $\\vec{v_1'}$, and the CM velocity, $\\vec{V_{CM}}$:\n    $\\vec{v_1} = \\vec{v_1'} + \\vec{V_{CM}}$\n\n    Let $\\theta$ be the scattering angle of the heavier particle in the lab frame (the angle between $\\vec{v_1}$ and the initial direction of $u_1$).\n    Let $\\theta'$ be the scattering angle of the heavier particle in the CM frame (the angle between $\\vec{v_1'}$ and the initial direction of $u_1$).\n\n    We can express $\\tan\\theta$ using the components of $\\vec{v_1}$:\n    $v_{1x} = V_{CM} + v_1' \\cos\\theta'$\n    $v_{1y} = v_1' \\sin\\theta'$\n    $\\tan\\theta = \\frac{v_{1y}}{v_{1x}} = \\frac{v_1' \\sin\\theta'}{V_{CM} + v_1' \\cos\\theta'}$\n\n    Substitute the values $v_1' = \\frac{1}{3} u_1$ and $V_{CM} = \\frac{2}{3} u_1$:\n    $\\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} u_1 \\sin\\theta'}{\\frac{2}{3} u_1 + \\frac{1}{3} u_1 \\cos\\theta'} = \\frac{\\sin\\theta'}{2 + \\cos\\theta'}$\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximum Angular Deviation ($\\theta_{max}$):**\n    To find the maximum value of $\\theta$, we differentiate $\\tan\\theta$ with respect to $\\theta'$ and set the derivative to zero:\n    $\\frac{d(\\tan\\theta)}{d\\theta'} = \\frac{(\\cos\\theta')(2 + \\cos\\theta') - (\\sin\\theta')(-\\sin\\theta')}{(2 + \\cos\\theta')^2} = 0$\n    $2\\cos\\theta' + \\cos^2\\theta' + \\sin^2\\theta' = 0$\n    $2\\cos\\theta' + 1 = 0$\n    $\\cos\\theta' = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n    This value of $\\cos\\theta'$ corresponds to $\\theta' = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ (or $120^\\circ$).\n    Now, we find $\\sin\\theta'$ for this value:\n    $\\sin\\theta' = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\theta'} = \\sqrt{1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ (since $\\theta'$ is in the range $[0, \\pi]$ for scattering, $\\sin\\theta'$ is positive).\n\n    Substitute these values back into the expression for $\\tan\\theta$:\n    $\\tan\\theta_{max} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2 + (-\\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n    Therefore, $\\theta_{max} = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ radians.\n\nAlternatively, a general formula for the maximum scattering angle of the incident particle ($M_1$) in an elastic collision with a stationary target ($M_2$) is:\nIf $M_1 > M_2$, then $\\sin\\theta_{max} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1}$.\nIn this problem, $M_1 = 2m$ and $M_2 = m$. Since $M_1 > M_2$:\n$\\sin\\theta_{max} = \\frac{m}{2m} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nTherefore, $\\theta_{max} = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ radians.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe final answer is $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$."

Its area is $A = a^2$.\n    The loop's lower edge is hinged along the X-axis. At $t=0$, it lies in the XZ plane.\n    It rotates with constant angular speed $\\omega$ about the X-axis in the clockwise direction as viewed from the +X axis.\n\n2.  **Analyze the magnetic field region:**\n    The magnetic field is $\\vec{B}(t) = B_0(\\cos \\omega t)\\hat{k}$ only in the region $y \\ge 0$. It is zero everywhere else.\n\n3.  **Determine the loop's position and orientation:**\n    If the loop starts in the XZ plane ($y=0$), a point $(x,0,z_0)$ on the loop at $t=0$ will move to $(x, -z_0 \\sin(\\omega t), z_0 \\cos(\\omega t))$ after rotating clockwise about the X-axis (as viewed from +X). For the loop to be in the region $y \\ge 0$ where the magnetic field exists, its Y-coordinate, $y = -z_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$, must be non-negative. Since $\\sin(\\omega t) \\ge 0$ for $0 \\le \\omega t \\le \\pi$, this implies that $z_0$ must be $\\le 0$. Therefore, the loop must initially be in the XZ plane with its area in the region $z \\le 0$ (i.e., below the X-axis). This interpretation is crucial because if $z_0 > 0$ (as might be suggested by a typical diagram showing 'up' as +Z), the loop would rotate into the $y < 0$ region, and the flux would always be zero, leading to zero EMF, which is not among the options.\n\n4.  **Determine the area vector of the loop:**\n    Assuming the loop starts in the XZ plane with $z \\in [-a, 0]$, its initial normal vector (using the right-hand rule, e.g., for current flowing from (0,0,0) to (a,0,0) to (a,0,-a) to (0,0,-a)) would be along the +Y axis. So, $\\vec{A}(0) = a^2 \\hat{j}$.\n    As it rotates clockwise about the X-axis, the Y-axis rotates towards the -Z axis. Thus, the area vector at time t is:\n    $\\vec{A}(t) = a^2 (\\cos(\\omega t)\\hat{j} - \\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{k})$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the magnetic flux ($\\Phi_B$):**\n    The magnetic flux through the loop is $\\Phi_B(t) = \\vec{B}(t) \\cdot \\vec{A}(t)$.\n    $\\Phi_B(t) = (B_0 \\cos \\omega t \\hat{k}) \\cdot (a^2 (\\cos(\\omega t)\\hat{j} - \\sin(\\omega t)\\hat{k}))$\n    $\\Phi_B(t) = B_0 a^2 (\\cos \\omega t)(-\\sin \\omega t)$\n    $\\Phi_B(t) = -B_0 a^2 \\sin(\\omega t) \\cos(\\omega t)$\n    Using the identity $\\sin(2\theta) = 2 \\sin\theta \\cos\theta$, we get:\n    $\\Phi_B(t) = -\\frac{1}{2} B_0 a^2 \\sin(2\\omega t)$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the induced e.m.f. (V):**\n    According to Faraday's law of induction, $V(t) = - \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}$.\n    $V(t) = - \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} B_0 a^2 \\sin(2\\omega t) \right)$\n    $V(t) = \\frac{1}{2} B_0 a^2 \\frac{d}{dt} (\\sin(2\\omega t))$\n    $V(t) = \\frac{1}{2} B_0 a^2 (2\\omega \\cos(2\\omega t))$\n    $V(t) = B_0 a^2 \\omega \\cos(2\\omega t)$.\n\n7.  **Match the e.m.f. function to the given graphs:**\n    The induced e.m.f. is a cosine function with amplitude $V_{max} = B_0 a^2 \\omega$ and angular frequency $2\\omega$.

So, the e.m.f. starts at a positive maximum.\n    Let's check the behavior at key points:\n    -   At $t=0$, $V = V_{max}$ (positive peak).\n    -   At $t = \\frac{\\pi}{4\\omega}$, $2\\omega t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $V = V_{max} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$.\n    -   At $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}$, $2\\omega t = \\pi$, $V = V_{max} \\cos(\\pi) = -V_{max}$ (negative peak).\n    -   At $t = \\frac{3\\pi}{4\\omega}$, $2\\omega t = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, $V = V_{max} \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = 0$.\n    -   At $t = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$, $2\\omega t = 2\\pi$, $V = V_{max} \\cos(2\\pi) = V_{max}$ (positive peak, completes one cycle).\n\n    Comparing this behavior with the given options, graph (A) correctly represents $V(t) = V_{max} \\cos(2\\omega t)$. It starts at a positive maximum, goes to zero at $t=\\pi/(4\\omega)$, reaches a negative maximum at $t=\\pi/(2\\omega)$, and so on.\n\n    The interpretation of the initial position ($z<0$) is crucial for the loop to be in the magnetic field region ($y \\ge 0$) while rotating clockwise. If the loop started with $z>0$ (as often depicted in general diagrams), it would rotate into the $y<0$ region, and the flux would always be zero, leading to zero EMF, which contradicts the options. Given that a non-zero EMF graph is expected, the interpretation leading to option (A) is the most consistent one.\n\nThe final answer is $\boxed{\text{A}}$"

Motion while entering the magnetic field (0 < y < L):**\nLet y be the depth of the loop inside the magnetic field. The velocity of the loop is $v = \\frac{dy}{dt}$.\nThe induced electromotive force (EMF) in the top edge of the loop (the part entering the field) is $\\mathcal{E} = B_0Lv$.\nThe induced current in the loop is $I = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R} = \\frac{B_0Lv}{R}$.\nBy Lenz's law, the direction of the induced current will oppose the increase in magnetic flux. As the loop enters, the flux into the page increases, so the current will be counter-clockwise. This means the current in the top edge flows to the right (along +x direction).\nThe magnetic force on the top edge is $F_B = ILB_0$. Since the current is in the +x direction and the magnetic field is in the +z direction, the force $\\vec{F} = I(\\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B})$ will be in the -y direction (upwards, opposing the motion).\n$F_B = (\\frac{B_0Lv}{R})LB_0 = \\frac{B_0^2L^2v}{R}$.\nThis force acts as a retarding force. According to Newton's second law:\n$M\\frac{dv}{dt} = -F_B = -\\frac{B_0^2L^2v}{R}$\nGiven $K = \\frac{B_0^2L^2}{RM}$, we can write:\n$M\\frac{dv}{dt} = -KMv$\n$\\frac{dv}{dt} = -Kv$\nThis is a first-order differential equation. Integrating from $t=0$ (where $v=v_0$) to time $t$ (where velocity is $v$):\n$\\int_{v_0}^{v} \\frac{dv'}{v'} = \\int_{0}^{t} -K dt'$\n$\\ln(\\frac{v}{v_0}) = -Kt$\n$v(t) = v_0 e^{-Kt}$\n\nTo find the distance traveled (depth y) into the field:\n$v = \\frac{dy}{dt} \\implies dy = v_0 e^{-Kt} dt$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ (where $y=0$) to time $t$ (where depth is $y$):\n$\\int_{0}^{y} dy' = \\int_{0}^{t} v_0 e^{-Kt} dt'$\n$y(t) = v_0 [-\\frac{1}{K}e^{-Kt}]_{0}^{t} = -\\frac{v_0}{K}(e^{-Kt} - 1) = \\frac{v_0}{K}(1 - e^{-Kt})$\n\n**2. Motion when the complete loop is inside the magnetic field (y \\ge L):**\nWhen the entire loop is inside the uniform magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the loop is constant ($\\Phi = B_0L^2$).\nSince the magnetic flux is constant, the induced EMF is zero ($\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = 0$).\nConsequently, the induced current is zero ($I = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R} = 0$).\nSince there is no induced current, the magnetic force on the loop is zero ($F_B = 0$).\nAs gravity is ignored, the net force acting on the loop is zero. Therefore, the loop moves with constant velocity (the velocity it had when it fully entered the field).\n\n**Now let's evaluate each statement:**\n\n**(A) If $v_0 = 1.5KL$, the loop will stop before it enters completely inside the region of magnetic field.**\nFrom the velocity equation, $v(t) = v_0 e^{-Kt}$. For $v(t)$ to be zero, $e^{-Kt}$ must be zero, which only happens as $t \\to \\infty$. This means the loop never truly \"stops\" in a finite amount of time. It only asymptotically approaches rest.\nFurthermore, for the loop to enter completely, we need $y(t) = L$ to be achievable. The maximum distance the loop can travel into the field is $y_{max} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\frac{v_0}{K}$.\nIf $v_0 = 1.5KL$, then $y_{max} = \\frac{1.5KL}{K} = 1.5L$. Since $1.5L > L$, the loop will indeed enter completely into the magnetic field. It will not stop before entering completely.\nThus, statement (A) is incorrect.\n\n**(B) When the complete loop is inside the region of magnetic field, the net force acting on the loop is zero.**\nAs derived in section 2, when the entire loop is inside the uniform magnetic field, the magnetic flux through it is constant, leading to zero induced EMF, zero induced current, and thus zero magnetic force. Since gravity is ignored, the net force on the loop is zero.\nThus, statement (B) is correct.\n\n**(C) If $v_0 = \\frac{KL}{10}$, the loop comes to rest at $t = (\\frac{1}{K})\\ln{(\\frac{5}{2})}$.**\nAgain, the loop never comes to rest in finite time, as $v(t) = v_0 e^{-Kt}$ only approaches zero asymptotically.\nLet's check if the loop even enters completely. For $v_0 = \\frac{KL}{10}$, the maximum distance it can travel is $y_{max} = \\frac{v_0}{K} = \\frac{KL/10}{K} = \\frac{L}{10}$.\nSince $y_{max} = L/10 < L$, the loop will never fully enter the magnetic field. It will asymptotically approach rest at a depth of $L/10$. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.\nThus, statement (C) is incorrect.\n\n**(D) If $v_0 = 3KL$, the complete loop enters inside the region of magnetic field at time $t = (\\frac{1}{K})\\ln{(\\frac{3}{2})}$.**\nThe loop enters completely when $y(t) = L$. We use the equation $y(t) = \\frac{v_0}{K}(1 - e^{-Kt})$.\nSet $y(t) = L$: $L = \\frac{v_0}{K}(1 - e^{-Kt_{enter}})$.\n$1 - e^{-Kt_{enter}} = \\frac{KL}{v_0}$\n$e^{-Kt_{enter}} = 1 - \\frac{KL}{v_0}$\n$t_{enter} = -\\frac{1}{K}\\ln(1 - \\frac{KL}{v_0}) = \\frac{1}{K}\\ln(\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{KL}{v_0}}) = \\frac{1}{K}\\ln(\\frac{v_0}{v_0 - KL})$.\nNow substitute $v_0 = 3KL$:\n$t_{enter} = \\frac{1}{K}\\ln(\\frac{3KL}{3KL - KL}) = \\frac{1}{K}\\ln(\\frac{3KL}{2KL}) = \\frac{1}{K}\\ln(\\frac{3}{2})$.\nThis matches the time given in the statement. Also, since $v_0 = 3KL > KL$, the loop will indeed enter completely.\nThus, statement (D) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statements (B) and (D) are correct."

The plates are perfect black bodies, so they emit radiation according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, E = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. The net power transferred per unit area between two black bodies at temperatures T₁ and T₂ is given by P_net = σ(T₁⁴ - T₂⁴).\n\n**Scenario 1 (Fig. 1):**\nTwo plates P and Q are present at temperatures Tp and TQ, respectively.\nThe power transferred per unit area from P to Q is Wo.\nSince P and Q are the only two plates exchanging heat, the net power transferred is directly given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the temperature difference.\nWo = σ(Tp⁴ - TQ⁴)  --- (1)\n\n**Scenario 2 (Fig. 2):**\nTwo additional plates, M1 and M2, are introduced between P and Q. Let their steady-state temperatures be Tm1 and Tm2, respectively.\nThe heat transfer takes place only between adjacent plates. In the steady state, the power transferred per unit area across each gap must be the same. Let this power be Ws.\n\nSo, we have three heat transfer paths:\n1.  From P to M1: Ws = σ(Tp⁴ - Tm1⁴) --- (2)\n2.  From M1 to M2: Ws = σ(Tm1⁴ - Tm2⁴) --- (3)\n3.

I will analyze each item in List-II to determine its dependency on Z and then find the correct match from List-I.\n\nLet's analyze each entry:\n\n**List-II Analysis:**\n\n*   **(1) energy of characteristic x-rays:** Characteristic x-rays are produced due to electronic transitions in inner shells. According to Moseley's Law, the frequency (and thus energy) of characteristic x-rays is proportional to (Z-b)^2, where 'b' is a screening constant (approximately 1 for K-series x-rays). Therefore, E ∝ (Z - 1)^2. This matches with (Q).\n    *   So, Q → 1.\n\n*   **(2) electrostatic part of the nuclear binding energy for stable nuclei with mass numbers in the range 30 to 170:** The electrostatic (Coulomb) repulsion energy between protons in a nucleus is given by the term in the semi-empirical mass formula as E_c = a_c * Z(Z-1) / A^(1/3). This term is proportional to Z(Z-1). This matches with (R).\n    *   So, R → 2.\n\n*   **(3) energy of continuous x-rays:** Continuous x-rays (Bremsstrahlung) are produced when electrons are decelerated by the electric field of the nucleus. The maximum energy of continuous x-rays is determined by the accelerating voltage (E_max = eV) and is independent of the atomic number Z of the target material. While the intensity of Bremsstrahlung is proportional to Z^2, the *energy* (specifically, the maximum energy or the cutoff energy) is not dependent on Z. Thus, E is practically independent of Z. This could match with (S).\n\n*   **(4) average nuclear binding energy per nucleon for stable nuclei with mass number in the range 30 to 170:** For stable nuclei in the mass number range of approximately 30 to 170, the average nuclear binding energy per nucleon is remarkably constant (around 8.5 MeV/nucleon). This value is largely independent of the atomic number Z (or mass number A) in this range. Thus, E is practically independent of Z. This could match with (S).\n\n*   **(5) energy of radiation due to electronic transitions from hydrogen-like atoms:** For hydrogen-like atoms, the energy of an electron in a given shell 'n' is E_n = -13.6 * Z^2 / n^2 eV. The energy of radiation emitted during a transition between two shells (n_i to n_f) is E = E_n_i - E_n_f = 13.6 * Z^2 * (1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2). Therefore, E ∝ Z^2. This matches with (P).\n    *   So, P → 5.\n\n**Summary of confirmed matches so far:**\n*   P → 5\n*   Q → 1\n*   R → 2\n\nNow let's check the given options based on these confirmed matches:\n\n*   **(A) P→4, Q→3, R→1, S→2:** Incorrect (P, Q, R are wrong).\n*   **(B) P→5, Q→2, R→1, S→4:** Incorrect (Q, R are wrong).\n*   **(C) P→5, Q→1, R→2, S→4:** All P, Q, R matches are correct. Let's check S → 4.\n    *   S → 4: E is practically independent of Z for average nuclear binding energy per nucleon for stable nuclei with mass numbers in the range 30 to 170. This is correct.\n*   **(D) P→3, Q→2, R→1, S→5:** Incorrect (P, Q, R are wrong).\n\nOption (C) is the only one that correctly matches P, Q, and R. The match for S (S → 4) is also consistent with physical principles.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is P→5, Q→1, R→2, S→4."

Conversely, a smaller Δo corresponds to lower energy absorption and a longer λmax.\n\n2.  **Oxidation State of Cobalt:**\n    Let's determine the oxidation state of cobalt in each complex:\n    *   [Co(CN)₆]³⁻: x + 6(-1) = -3 => x = +3\n    *   [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺: x + 6(0) = +3 => x = +3\n    *   [Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺: x + 5(0) + 0 = +3 => x = +3\n    *   [Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺: x + 5(0) + (-1) = +2 => x = +3\n    All complexes involve Co(III) as the central metal ion.

Strong field ligands cause a large Δo, while weak field ligands cause a small Δo.\n    The relevant portion of the spectrochemical series for the ligands present is:\n    Cl⁻ (weak field) < H₂O < NH₃ < CN⁻ (strong field)\n\n4.  **Order of Δo for the Complexes:**\n    Based on the spectrochemical series, we can order the complexes by increasing Δo:\n    *   [Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺ (contains Cl⁻, the weakest field ligand among the options)\n    *   [Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺ (contains H₂O, stronger than Cl⁻)\n    *   [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ (contains NH₃, stronger than H₂O)\n    *   [Co(CN)₆]³⁻ (contains CN⁻, the strongest field ligand among the options)\n\n    So, the order of increasing Δo is:\n    Δo([Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺) < Δo([Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺) < Δo([Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺) < Δo([Co(CN)₆]³⁻)\n\n5.  **Order of λmax for the Complexes:**\n    Since λmax is inversely proportional to Δo, the order of increasing λmax will be the reverse of the Δo order:\n    λmax([Co(CN)₆]³⁻) < λmax([Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺) < λmax([Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺) < λmax([Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺)\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    (A) [Co(CN)₆]³⁻ < [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ < [Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺ < [Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺\n    This matches our derived order.\n\n    (B) [Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺ < [Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺ < [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ < [Co(CN)₆]³⁻ (This is the order of increasing Δo, not λmax)\n    (C) [Co(CN)₆]³⁻ < [Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺ < [Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺ < [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ (Incorrect)\n    (D) [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ < [Co(CN)₆]³⁻ < [Co(NH₃)₅(Cl)]²⁺ < [Co(NH₃)₅(H₂O)]³⁺ (Incorrect)\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$"

Multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2 to get 6 electrons:\n    2MnO4-(aq) + 4H2O(l) + 6e- → 2MnO2(s) + 8OH-(aq)\n\n    Now, add the oxidation and reduction half-reactions:\n    (I-(aq) + 6OH-(aq) → IO3-(aq) + 3H2O(l) + 6e-)\n    + (2MnO4-(aq) + 4H2O(l) + 6e- → 2MnO2(s) + 8OH-(aq))\n    ----------------------------------------------------------\n    I-(aq) + 2MnO4-(aq) + H2O(l) → IO3-(aq) + 2MnO2(s) + 2OH-(aq)\n\nThis balanced equation shows that iodate (IO3-) is a product of the reaction. In neutral medium, the oxidation of I- by MnO4- commonly proceeds to IO3-.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n(A) I2: While I2 is an oxidation product of I-, in the presence of a strong oxidizer like MnO4- in neutral conditions, it is typically oxidized further to IO3-.\n(B) IO3-: This is a common and expected product, as confirmed by the balanced reaction.\n(C) IO4-: Oxidation to periodate (IO4-) usually requires even stronger oxidizing conditions or a higher concentration of the oxidizing agent, often in highly alkaline media.\n(D) IO2-: Iodite (IO2-) is an intermediate oxidation state (+3) and is less stable or less common as a final product compared to iodate (+5).\n\nTherefore, IO3- is one of the products formed."

      "reasoning": "The acidity of a hydrogen atom is determined by the stability of its conjugate base. A more stable conjugate base corresponds to a more acidic hydrogen.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the provided descriptions:\n\n1.  **Options (A) and (C):** In both (A) and (C), the depicted hydrogen (H) is attached to a methyl group, which is itself attached to an sp3 hybridized carbon of the five-membered ring. When this hydrogen is removed, the resulting carbanion is on an sp3 carbon and is not resonance stabilized. These are typical alkane-like hydrogens, which are very weakly acidic (pKa ~ 50).\n\n2.  **Options (B) and (D):** In both (B) and (D), the depicted hydrogen (H) is described as being attached to a 'carbon adjacent to the ring'. Given the context of a 'five-membered ring with a double bond to an exocyclic methylene group', this 'carbon adjacent to the ring' most likely refers to an allylic carbon within the ring. An allylic carbon is an sp3 hybridized carbon directly adjacent to a double bond. When a hydrogen from an allylic carbon is removed, the resulting carbanion is resonance stabilized by delocalization of the negative charge onto the adjacent double bond. This resonance stabilization significantly increases the acidity of allylic hydrogens compared to simple alkane hydrogens (pKa ~ 40-43).\n\nTherefore, the most acidic hydrogen must be either in option (B) or (D), as they are the only ones that lead to resonance-stabilized carbanions.\n\n**Comparing (B) and (D):**\nThe descriptions for options (B) and (D) are identical. This implies that the actual structures in the original question's image must have a subtle difference that the text description fails to capture. In the absence of the image, we must consider the factors that differentiate the acidity of allylic hydrogens:\n    *   **Degree of substitution of the carbanion:** Alkyl groups are electron-donating and destabilize a negative charge. Therefore, a less substituted carbanion is more stable than a more substituted one. The order of stability for carbanions is primary > secondary > tertiary. Consequently, a primary allylic hydrogen is more acidic than a secondary allylic hydrogen, which is more acidic than a tertiary allylic hydrogen.\n\nSince both (B) and (D) involve allylic hydrogens, the most acidic one would be the one that forms the least substituted (most stable) allylic carbanion. Without the visual representation, it's impossible to definitively distinguish between (B) and (D) based solely on the provided text. However, in a multiple-choice question where a unique answer is expected, it is implied that one of these options represents the most acidic scenario (e.g., a secondary allylic hydrogen, which is generally more acidic than a tertiary allylic hydrogen if such a distinction exists between B and D).\n\nAssuming the question is well-posed and there is a unique correct answer, and given that (B) and (D) are the only plausible options, one of them must represent the most acidic allylic hydrogen (likely a secondary allylic hydrogen).\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the requirement to provide a single answer, I will select (B) as the most probable answer, assuming it corresponds to the most stable allylic carbanion (e.g., a secondary allylic carbanion) among the choices."

So, Ne2 has 20 electrons.\n*   The molecular orbital (MO) configuration for Ne2 is:\n    (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)² (σ*2s)² (σ2pz)² (π2px)² (π2py)² (π*2px)² (π*2py)²\n*   Number of bonding electrons (Nb) = 2 (σ1s) + 2 (σ2s) + 2 (σ2pz) + 2 (π2px) + 2 (π2py) = 10\n*   Number of antibonding electrons (Na) = 2 (σ*1s) + 2 (σ*2s) + 2 (π*2px) + 2 (π*2py) = 8. Wait, I made a mistake in counting Na for Ne2 in my scratchpad. Let's re-count carefully.\n    (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)² (σ*2s)² (σ2pz)² (π2px)² (π2py)² (π*2px)² (π*2py)²\n    Nb = 2+2+2+2+2 = 10\n    Na = 2+2+2+2 = 8. This is still 8. Let's check the total electrons. 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 18 electrons. I need 20 electrons.\n    The MO configuration for Ne2 should fill all orbitals up to π*2p.\n    (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)² (σ*2s)² (σ2pz)² (π2px)² (π2py)² (π*2px)² (π*2py)²\n    Nb = 2 (σ1s) + 2 (σ2s) + 2 (σ2pz) + 2 (π2px) + 2 (π2py) = 10\n    Na = 2 (σ*1s) + 2 (σ*2s) + 2 (π*2px) + 2 (π*2py) = 10\n    Bond order = 1/2 (Nb - Na) = 1/2 (10 - 10) = 0.\n*   Therefore, the statement is **correct**.\n\n**(B) The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of F2 is σ-type.**\n*   Fluorine (F) has 9 electrons. So, F2 has 18 electrons.\n*   The MO configuration for F2 (for molecules with Z > 7, like O2, F2, Ne2, the order is σ2pz before π2px/π2py):\n    (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)² (σ*2s)² (σ2pz)² (π2px)² (π2py)² (π*2px)² (π*2py)²\n*   Let's count electrons: 2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 14 electrons filled up to π2py. The remaining 4 electrons go into π*2px and π*2py.\n*   The HOMO is the highest energy orbital that contains electrons. In this case, it is the π*2p molecular orbital (specifically π*2px and π*2py, which are degenerate).\n*   Therefore, the statement that HOMO of F2 is σ-type is **incorrect**. It is π*-type.\n\n**(C) Bond energy of O2+ is smaller than the bond energy of O2.**\n*   Oxygen (O) has 8 electrons. So, O2 has 16 electrons.\n*   MO configuration for O2: (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)² (σ*2s)² (σ2pz)² (π2px)² (π2py)² (π*2px)¹ (π*2py)¹\n*   Bond order of O2 = 1/2 (Nb - Na) = 1/2 (10 - 6) = 2.\n*   O2+ molecule has 15 electrons (one electron removed from O2). The electron is removed from the highest energy occupied orbital, which is π*2p.\n*   MO configuration for O2+: (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)² (σ*2s)² (σ2pz)² (π2px)² (π2py)² (π*2px)¹\n*   Bond order of O2+ = 1/2 (Nb - Na) = 1/2 (10 - 5) = 2.5.\n*   Generally, a higher bond order corresponds to a stronger bond and thus higher bond energy.\n*   Since the bond order of O2+ (2.5) is greater than the bond order of O2 (2), the bond energy of O2+ should be *larger* than the bond energy of O2.\n*   Therefore, the statement that bond energy of O2+ is smaller than the bond energy of O2 is **incorrect**.\n\n**(D) Bond length of Li2 is larger than the bond length of B2.**\n*   Lithium (Li) has 3 electrons. So, Li2 has 6 electrons.\n*   MO configuration for Li2: (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)²\n*   Bond order of Li2 = 1/2 (Nb - Na) = 1/2 (4 - 2) = 1.\n*   Boron (B) has 5 electrons. So, B2 has 10 electrons.\n*   MO configuration for B2 (for molecules with Z <= 7, like B2, C2, N2, the order is π2px/π2py before σ2pz):\n    (σ1s)² (σ*1s)² (σ2s)² (σ*2s)² (π2px)¹ (π2py)¹\n*   Bond order of B2 = 1/2 (Nb - Na) = 1/2 (6 - 4) = 1.\n*   Both Li2 and B2 have a bond order of 1. However, bond length is also influenced by atomic size. Lithium (Li) is a larger atom than Boron (B) because atomic radius decreases across a period. Larger atoms generally form longer bonds. The bonding electrons in Li2 are in the σ2s orbital, while in B2 they are in the π2p orbitals. The 2s orbital is more diffuse and extends further than 2p orbitals, contributing to a larger bond length.\n*   Experimental bond lengths: Li2 ≈ 267 pm, B2 ≈ 159 pm.\n*   Thus, the bond length of Li2 is indeed larger than the bond length of B2.\n*   Therefore, the statement is **correct**.\n\nThe incorrect statements are (B) and (C)."

HBr adds across the double bond of cyclohexene to form bromocyclohexane. So, P is Cyclohexyl-Br. (X = Br)\n\n2.  **P (Bromocyclohexane) --(Finkelstein reaction)--> Q**: The Finkelstein reaction is a halogen exchange reaction where an alkyl bromide (or chloride) is converted to an alkyl iodide using NaI in acetone. So, Q is Cyclohexyl-I. (X = I)\n\n3.  **P (Bromocyclohexane) --(Swarts reaction)--> R**: The Swarts reaction is a halogen exchange reaction where an alkyl bromide (or chloride) is converted to an alkyl fluoride using metallic fluorides like AgF. So, R is Cyclohexyl-F. (X = F)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**Statement (A): C–X bond length in P, Q and R follows the order Q > R > P.**\n*   The bond length of a C-X bond depends on the size of the halogen atom. As the atomic size increases down the group, the bond length increases.\n*   Atomic size order: F < Br < I.\n*   Therefore, the C-X bond length order is: C-F (R) < C-Br (P) < C-I (Q).\n*   So, the correct order is R < P < Q, or Q > P > R.\n*   The statement says Q > R > P, which is incorrect.\n\n**Statement (B): C–X bond enthalpy in P, Q and R follows the order R > P > Q.**\n*   Bond enthalpy (or bond strength) is inversely related to bond length. Shorter bonds are generally stronger.\n*   Since the bond length order is R (C-F) < P (C-Br) < Q (C-I),\n*   The bond enthalpy order should be: C-F (R) > C-Br (P) > C-I (Q).\n*   This matches the statement: R > P > Q. So, statement (B) is correct.\n\n**Statement (C): Relative reactivity toward SN2 reaction in P, Q and R follows the order P > R > Q.**\n*   SN2 reactivity is primarily determined by the leaving group ability. A good leaving group is a weak base.\n*   The leaving groups are the halide ions: F⁻ (from R), Br⁻ (from P), I⁻ (from Q).\n*   The basicity of halide ions follows the order: F⁻ > Cl⁻ > Br⁻ > I⁻ (I⁻ is the weakest base and thus the best leaving group).\n*   Therefore, the leaving group ability order is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > F⁻.\n*   The SN2 reactivity order is: Q (Cyclohexyl-I) > P (Cyclohexyl-Br) > R (Cyclohexyl-F).\n*   The statement says P > R > Q, which is incorrect.\n\n**Statement (D): pKa value of the conjugate acids of the leaving groups in P, Q and R follows the order R > Q > P.**\n*   The conjugate acids of the leaving groups (F⁻, Br⁻, I⁻) are HF, HBr, and HI, respectively.\n*   The acidity of hydrohalic acids follows the order: HI > HBr > HCl > HF (HI is the strongest acid, HF is the weakest acid).\n*   pKa is inversely related to acid strength. Therefore, the pKa order is: HF > HCl > HBr > HI.\n*   In terms of P, Q, R: pKa(HF) (R) > pKa(HBr) (P) > pKa(HI) (Q).\n*   So, the correct order is R > P > Q.\n*   The statement says R > Q > P, which is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement (B) is correct."

Let [H⁺] be the total concentration of H⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\nThe relevant equilibrium constants are:\nKₐ = ([H⁺][A⁻]) / [HA]\nK𝓌 = [H⁺][OH⁻]\n\nWe also have the mass balance for the acid species:\nC = [HA] + [A⁻]\n\nAnd the charge balance equation:\n[H⁺] = [A⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\nFrom the charge balance, [A⁻] = [H⁺] - [OH⁻].\nFrom K𝓌, [OH⁻] = K𝓌 / [H⁺].\nSo, [A⁻] = [H⁺] - K𝓌 / [H⁺].\n\nSubstitute [A⁻] into the mass balance equation:\n[HA] = C - [A⁻] = C - ([H⁺] - K𝓌 / [H⁺])\n\nNow, substitute [A⁻] and [HA] into the Kₐ expression:\nKₐ = ([H⁺] * ([H⁺] - K𝓌 / [H⁺])) / (C - ([H⁺] - K𝓌 / [H⁺]))\nKₐ = ([H⁺]² - K𝓌) / (C - [H⁺] + K𝓌 / [H⁺])\n\nRearranging this equation leads to a cubic equation for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺]³ + Kₐ[H⁺]² - (KₐC + K𝓌)[H⁺] - KₐK𝓌 = 0\n\nGiven values:\nC = 1.00 × 10⁻³ M\nKₐ = 4.00 × 10⁻¹¹\nK𝓌 = 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\nLet's analyze the relative magnitudes of the terms to determine if any approximations can be made.\n\nFirst, let's consider the common approximation for weak acids: [H⁺]² = KₐC (ignoring water dissociation).\n[H⁺]² = (4.00 × 10⁻¹¹) * (1.00 × 10⁻³) = 4.00 × 10⁻¹⁴\n[H⁺] = √(4.00 × 10⁻¹⁴) = 2.00 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nNow, let's check if water dissociation is negligible. If [H⁺] = 2.00 × 10⁻⁷ M, then [OH⁻] = K𝓌 / [H⁺] = (1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (2.00 × 10⁻⁷) = 0.50 × 10⁻⁷ M. Since [H⁺] (2.00 × 10⁻⁷ M) is not significantly larger than [OH⁻] (0.50 × 10⁻⁷ M), the contribution from water dissociation cannot be ignored.\n\nIn cases where the acid is very weak (small Kₐ) and/or dilute, the approximation [HA] ≈ C is often valid (i.e., [A⁻] << C). If this holds, the Kₐ expression simplifies:\nKₐ = ([H⁺][A⁻]) / C\nFrom charge balance, [A⁻] = [H⁺] - [OH⁻] = [H⁺] - K𝓌 / [H⁺].\nSubstitute [A⁻] into the simplified Kₐ expression:\nKₐ = ([H⁺] * ([H⁺] - K𝓌 / [H⁺])) / C\nKₐ = ([H⁺]² - K𝓌) / C\nRearranging gives:\n[H⁺]² = KₐC + K𝓌\n\nLet's use this approximation:\n[H⁺]² = (4.00 × 10⁻¹¹) * (1.00 × 10⁻³) + 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴\n[H⁺]² = 4.00 × 10⁻¹⁴ + 1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴\n[H⁺]² = 5.00 × 10⁻¹⁴\n[H⁺] = √(5.00 × 10⁻¹⁴)\n[H⁺] = √5 × 10⁻⁷ M\n\nNow, let's check the validity of the approximation [HA] ≈ C. This means [A⁻] should be much smaller than C.\n[H⁺] = √5 × 10⁻⁷ M ≈ 2.236 × 10⁻⁷ M.\n[A⁻] = [H⁺] - K𝓌 / [H⁺] = 2.236 × 10⁻⁷ - (1.00 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (2.236 × 10⁻⁷)\n[A⁻] = 2.236 × 10⁻⁷ - 0.447 × 10⁻⁷ = 1.789 × 10⁻⁷ M.\nSince C = 1.00 × 10⁻³ M = 10000 × 10⁻⁷ M, [A⁻] (1.789 × 10⁻⁷ M) is indeed much smaller than C. So, the approximation [HA] ≈ C is valid.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of H⁺ ions is √5 × 10⁻⁷ M.\nThe problem states that the concentration of H⁺ ions is X × 10⁻⁷ M.\nSo, X = √5.\n\nCalculating the numerical value of X:\nX = √5 ≈ 2.236067977...\n\nThe instruction requires rounding off the value to two decimal places.\nX ≈ 2.24\n\nFinal Answer is 2.24."

The key to solving this problem is to identify the compounds P, Q, R, and S based on the reaction sequence and the given molar mass of P.\\n\\n1.  **Analyze the reaction sequence and functional group transformations:**\\n    *   P has a molar mass of 210 g/mol.\\n    *   Q is formed from P using NaOH, Δ.\\n    *   R is formed from Q using NaOH, CaO, Δ. This is a classic decarboxylation reaction, implying that Q is a carboxylic acid (or its salt) and R is the product after losing a CO2 group.\\n    *   S is formed from R using NaH. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates acidic hydrogens. If R is an alcohol, S would be its alkoxide.\\n    *   T is formed from R using PBr3. PBr3 converts alcohols to alkyl bromides. This confirms that R must be an alcohol.\\n\\n2.  **Work backward from R being an alcohol:**\\n    *   If R is an alcohol, then Q must be a carboxylic acid that decarboxylates to an alcohol. A common example is an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid (R'-CH(OH)-COOH) which decarboxylates to an alcohol (R'-CH2-OH).\\n    *   If Q is an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid, then P (a diketone) must have undergone a reaction to form it. The reaction that converts a 1,2-diketone to an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid in the presence of base (NaOH, Δ) is the **benzilic acid rearrangement**.\\n    *   Therefore, P must be a 1,2-diketone.\\n\\n3.  **Identify P:**\\n    *   P is a 1,2-diketone with a molar mass of 210 g/mol.\\n    *   Let the formula of P be CnHmO2. Molar mass = 12n + m + 2*16 = 210.\\n    *   12n + m = 210 - 32 = 178.\\n    *   Let's test common 1,2-diketones. Benzil (diphenylglyoxal, C6H5-CO-CO-C6H5) has the formula C14H10O2.\\n    *   Molar mass of C14H10O2 = 14*12 + 10*1 + 2*16 = 168 + 10 + 32 = 210 g/mol. This matches the given molar mass for P.\\n    *   So, P is Benzil (C14H10O2).\\n\\n4.  **Identify X:**\\n    *   X reacts with (i) Na, dry ether (ii) H3O+ to form P (Benzil).\\n    *   This reaction sequence is often used for reductive dehalogenation (replacing Br with H) or Wurtz-type coupling.\\n    *   If X is a dibrominated derivative of Benzil, say C14H8Br2O2, and it undergoes reductive dehalogenation (2Br replaced by 2H), it would form C14H10O2 (Benzil).\\n    *   Molar mass of C14H8Br2O2 = 14*12 + 8*1 + 2*80 + 2*16 = 168 + 8 + 160 + 32 = 368 g/mol.\\n    *   This interpretation is consistent with the reaction and the derived structure of P.

The interpretation of List-II entries is that they describe the synthesis of the *starting material* or a key *intermediate* for the reaction mentioned in List-I.\n\nLet's analyze each match:\n\n*   **(P) Stephen reaction:** This reaction involves the reduction of a nitrile (R-CN) to an aldehyde (R-CHO) using SnCl2/HCl followed by hydrolysis. We need a sequence that produces a nitrile.\n    *   List-II (2): Benzoic acid --(i) PCl5--> Benzoyl chloride --(ii) NH3--> Benzamide --(iii) P4O10, Δ--> Benzonitrile. This sequence successfully synthesizes Benzonitrile, which is the starting material for the Stephen reaction. So, P → 2 is a correct match.\n\n*   **(Q) Sandmeyer reaction:** This reaction involves the conversion of an arenediazonium salt (Ar-N2+X-) to an aryl halide or cyanide. The arenediazonium salt is typically formed from an aromatic amine via diazotization. We need a sequence that produces an arenediazonium salt.\n    *   List-II (3): Nitrobenzene --(i) Fe, HCl--> Aniline --(ii) HCl, NaNO2 (273-278 K), H2O--> Benzenediazonium chloride. This sequence synthesizes Benzenediazonium chloride, the key intermediate for the Sandmeyer reaction. So, Q → 3 is a correct match.\n\n*   **(R) Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction:** This reaction converts a primary amide (RCONH2) to a primary amine (RNH2) with one less carbon atom, using Br2/NaOH. We need a sequence that produces a primary amide.\n    *   List-II (4): Toluene --(i) Cl2/hv, H2O--> Benzaldehyde (via benzyl chloride and benzyl alcohol) --(ii) Tollen's reagent--> Benzoic acid --(iii) SO2Cl2--> Benzoyl chloride --(iv) NH3--> Benzamide. This sequence synthesizes Benzamide, which is the starting material for the Hoffmann bromamide degradation. So, R → 4 is a correct match.\n\n*   **(S) Cannizzaro reaction:** This reaction is a disproportionation of aldehydes lacking alpha-hydrogens (e.g., Benzaldehyde, Formaldehyde) in the presence of concentrated strong base. We need a sequence that produces such an aldehyde.\n    *   List-II (1): Toluene --(i) CrO2Cl2/CS2 (Etard reaction)--> Benzaldehyde --(ii) H3O+--> Benzaldehyde. This sequence synthesizes Benzaldehyde, a classic example of an aldehyde that undergoes the Cannizzaro reaction. So, S → 1 is a correct match.\n\nCombining these matches, we get: P→2; Q→3; R→4; S→1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n(A) P→2; Q → 4; R → 1; S → 3\n(B) P→2; Q → 3; R → 4; S → 1\n(C) P→5; Q → 3; R → 4; S → 2\n(D) P→5; Q → 4; R → 2; S → 1\n\nOption (B) matches our derived combination."

      "reasoning": "Let's analyze each compound in List-I and each observation in List-II to find the correct matches.\n\n**Analysis of List-I Compounds:**\n*   **(P) Tyrosyl-Glycine methyl ester:** This compound contains a free alpha-amino group (from the N-terminus of the peptide) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (from the tyrosine residue).\n*   **(Q) Benzoyl-Phenylalanine-Leucine methyl ester:** This is a peptide. The N-terminus is benzoylated, so there is no free alpha-amino group. It does not contain a phenolic hydroxyl group.\n*   **(R) Anilinium chloride (C6H5NH3+Cl-):** This is the salt of aniline. In aqueous solution, it can be in equilibrium with free aniline (C6H5NH2).\n*   **(S) 2,4-dimethylphenylhydrazine (C6H3(CH3)2NHNH2):** This compound contains a hydrazine (-NHNH2) functional group.\n\n**Analysis of List-II Observations and Matching:**\n*   **(1) Reaction with phenyl diazonium salt gives yellow dye.** This is characteristic of activated aromatic compounds like phenols and aromatic amines (anilines) that undergo azo coupling.\n    *   Compound P has a phenolic -OH, which is highly activated and can couple with diazonium salts.\n    *   Compound R (Anilinium chloride) can exist as free aniline in solution, and aniline reacts with diazonium salts to form azo dyes (e.g., p-aminoazobenzene, which is yellow/orange).\n    *   Let's keep both P and R as possibilities for now, but R is a more direct match for an 'aniline' type reaction.\n*   **(2) Reaction with ninhydrin gives purple color and it also reacts with FeCl3 to give violet color.**\n    *   **Ninhydrin test:** Positive for compounds with a free alpha-amino group (e.g., alpha-amino acids, or peptides with a free N-terminal alpha-amino acid).\n    *   **FeCl3 test:** Positive for phenols (gives a violet color).\n    *   Compound P has both a free alpha-amino group and a phenolic -OH group. Therefore, P perfectly matches observation (2).\n*   **(3) Reaction with glucose will give corresponding hydrazone.** This is a characteristic reaction of hydrazines (R-NHNH2) with aldehydes or ketones (glucose is an aldose, containing an aldehyde group).\n    *   Compound S is 2,4-dimethylphenylhydrazine, which has a hydrazine group. Therefore, S matches observation (3).\n*   **(4) Lassiagne extract of the compound treated with dilute HCl followed by addition of aqueous FeCl3 gives blood red color.** This test indicates the presence of both nitrogen and sulfur in the compound, forming thiocyanate (SCN-) in the Lassaigne's extract. None of the compounds P, Q, R, S contain sulfur. Thus, none of them would give a positive test for N+S. This observation is likely a distractor or not applicable to the given compounds.\n*   **(5) After complete hydrolysis, it will give ninhydrin test and it DOES NOT give positive phthalein dye test.**\n    *   **Complete hydrolysis and ninhydrin test:** This implies the compound is a peptide or protein that yields amino acids upon hydrolysis.\n    *   **DOES NOT give positive phthalein dye test:** The phthalein dye test is for phenols. This means the compound, or its hydrolysis products, should not contain a phenolic -OH group.\n    *   Compound Q is a peptide (Benzoyl-Phenylalanine-Leucine methyl ester). Upon complete hydrolysis, it will yield Phenylalanine and Leucine, both of which are alpha-amino acids and will give a positive ninhydrin test. Neither Phenylalanine nor Leucine (nor the original peptide Q) contains a phenolic -OH group. Therefore, Q matches observation (5).\n    *   Compound P, if hydrolyzed, would yield Tyrosine, which has a phenolic -OH and *would* give a positive phthalein dye test. So P does not match (5).\n\n**Summary of Matches based on analysis:**\n*   P → 2 (Strong match)\n*   Q → 5 (Strong match)\n*   S → 3 (Strong match)\n\nNow let's check the given options to see which one aligns with these strong matches:\n*   (A) P→1; Q → 5; R→ 4; S → 2 (Incorrect, S does not match 2)\n*   (B) P→2; Q → 5; R → 1; S → 3 (This option perfectly aligns with our strong matches. Let's verify R→1.)\n    *   R (Anilinium chloride) can react with phenyl diazonium salt (via equilibrium with aniline) to form a yellow azo dye. This is a plausible match.\n*   (C) P→5; Q → 2; R → 1; S → 4 (Incorrect, P does not match 5, Q does not match 2)\n*   (D) P→2; Q → 1; R → 5; S → 3 (Incorrect, Q does not match 1, R does not match 5)\n\nOption (B) provides the most consistent and chemically accurate set of matches.\n\n**Final Matching:**\n*   **(P) Tyrosyl-Glycine methyl ester** matches with **(2) Reaction with ninhydrin gives purple color and it also reacts with FeCl3 to give violet color.** (Due to free alpha-amino group and phenolic -OH).\n*   **(Q) Benzoyl-Phenylalanine-Leucine methyl ester** matches with **(5) After complete hydrolysis, it will give ninhydrin test and it DOES NOT give positive phthalein dye test.** (Due to peptide nature yielding amino acids, and absence of phenol).\n*   **(R) Anilinium chloride** matches with **(1) Reaction with phenyl diazonium salt gives yellow dye.** (Due to equilibrium with aniline, which undergoes azo coupling).\n*   **(S) 2,4-dimethylphenylhydrazine** matches with **(3) Reaction with glucose will give corresponding hydrazone.** (Due to the hydrazine group reacting with an aldehyde).\n\nThis confirms that option (B) is the correct choice."

Thus, $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.\nSince $f(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $f(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$, there is a unique real number $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = 0$.\nFrom $e^{x_0} + x_0 = 0$, we have $e^{x_0} = -x_0$. Since $e^{x_0} > 0$, it implies $-x_0 > 0$, so $x_0 < 0$.\n\nThe function $g(x)$ is given by:\n$g(x) = \\frac{3xe^x + 3x - \\alpha e^x - \\alpha x}{3(e^x + 1)}$\nWe can factor the numerator:\n$g(x) = \\frac{3x(e^x + 1) - \\alpha(e^x + x)}{3(e^x + 1)}$\nSplitting the fraction, we get:\n$g(x) = \\frac{3x(e^x + 1)}{3(e^x + 1)} - \\frac{\\alpha(e^x + x)}{3(e^x + 1)}$\n$g(x) = x - \\frac{\\alpha(e^x + x)}{3(e^x + 1)}$\n\nWe need to evaluate the limit $L = \\lim_{x \\to x_0} |\\frac{g(x) + e^{x_0}}{x - x_0}|$.\nFirst, let's check the value of the numerator at $x = x_0$:\n$g(x_0) = x_0 - \\frac{\\alpha(e^{x_0} + x_0)}{3(e^{x_0} + 1)}$\nSince $e^{x_0} + x_0 = 0$, the second term becomes zero:\n$g(x_0) = x_0 - \\frac{\\alpha(0)}{3(e^{x_0} + 1)} = x_0$.\nSo, $g(x_0) + e^{x_0} = x_0 + e^{x_0}$.\nSince $e^{x_0} + x_0 = 0$, we have $g(x_0) + e^{x_0} = 0$.\nThe limit is of the form $\\frac{0}{0}$.\n\nThe expression $\\lim_{x \\to x_0} \\frac{g(x) + e^{x_0}}{x - x_0}$ is the definition of the derivative of the function $h(x) = g(x) + e^{x_0}$ evaluated at $x_0$.

This means $\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{6t}{9+t^2})$ is always defined and its range is $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$.\n\nSo, the range of $\\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(\\frac{6t}{9+t^2})$ is $[-\\pi/4, \\pi/4]$.\nThe range of $\\tan^{-1}(2t)$ is $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$.\nLet RHS $= A - B$, where $A = \\tan^{-1}(2t)$ and $B = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(\\frac{6t}{9+t^2})$.\nThe minimum value of RHS is approached as $A \\to -\\pi/2$ and $B \\to \\pi/4$, so $-3\\pi/4$.\nThe maximum value of RHS is approached as $A \\to \\pi/2$ and $B \\to -\\pi/4$, so $3\\pi/4$.\nTherefore, $\\theta$ must be in the interval $(-3\\pi/4, 3\\pi/4)$.\n\nNow, let's simplify the term $\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{6t}{9+t^2})$. Let $t = 3 \\tan \\phi$. Then $\\frac{6t}{9+t^2} = \\frac{6(3 \\tan \\phi)}{9 + (3 \\tan \\phi)^2} = \\frac{18 \\tan \\phi}{9 + 9 \\tan^2 \\phi} = \\frac{2 \\tan \\phi}{1 + \\tan^2 \\phi} = \\sin(2\\phi)$.\nSo, $\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{6t}{9+t^2}) = \\sin^{-1}(\\sin(2\\phi))$.\nWe need to consider cases based on the value of $t$ (or $\\phi$).\n\nCase 1: $-1 \\le t/3 \\le 1 \\implies -3 \\le t \\le 3$.\nThis implies $-1 \\le \\tan \\phi \\le 1$, so $-\\pi/4 \\le \\phi \\le \\pi/4$. Thus, $- \\pi/2 \\le 2\\phi \\le \\pi/2$.\nIn this range, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(2\\phi)) = 2\\phi$. Since $t = 3 \\tan \\phi$, we have $\\phi = \\tan^{-1}(t/3)$.\nSo, $\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{6t}{9+t^2}) = 2 \\tan^{-1}(t/3)$.\nThe original equation becomes:\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2t) - \\frac{1}{2} (2 \\tan^{-1}(t/3))$\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2t) - \\tan^{-1}(t/3)$\n\nWe use the identity $\\tan^{-1} A - \\tan^{-1} B = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{A-B}{1+AB})$ if $AB > -1$.\nHere $A=2t$ and $B=t/3$. So $AB = 2t \\cdot (t/3) = 2t^2/3$. Since $t$ is real, $2t^2/3 \\ge 0$, which is always greater than $-1$.\nSo, $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2t - t/3}{1 + 2t^2/3}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{5t/3}{(3+2t^2)/3}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{5t}{3+2t^2}\\right)$.\n\nSince $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\text{expression})$, this implies that $\\theta$ must be the principal value of $\\tan^{-1}$, i.e., $\\theta \\in (-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$. This range is consistent with the overall range of $\\theta$ being $(-3\\pi/4, 3\\pi/4)$.\nTaking $\\tan$ on both sides:\n$\\tan \\theta = \\frac{5t}{3+2t^2}$\nSince $t = \\tan \\theta$, we substitute $t$ for $\tan \\theta$:\n$t = \\frac{5t}{3+2t^2}$\nThis equation implies either $t=0$ or $1 = \\frac{5}{3+2t^2}$.\n\nIf $t=0$: $\tan \\theta = 0$. The value of $\\theta$ in $(-3\\pi/4, 3\\pi/4)$ is $\\theta = 0$. (This satisfies $-3 \\le t \\le 3$).\nCheck: $0 = \\tan^{-1}(0) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(0) \\implies 0=0$. So $\\theta=0$ is a solution.\n\nIf $1 = \\frac{5}{3+2t^2}$: $3+2t^2 = 5 \\implies 2t^2 = 2 \\implies t^2 = 1 \\implies t = \\pm 1$.\nIf $t=1$: $\tan \\theta = 1$. The value of $\\theta$ in $(-3\\pi/4, 3\\pi/4)$ is $\\theta = \\pi/4$. (This satisfies $-3 \\le t \\le 3$).\nCheck: LHS = $\\pi/4$. RHS = $\\tan^{-1}(2) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(\\frac{6}{10}) = \\tan^{-1}(2) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(3/5)$.\nSince $t/3 = 1/3 \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(3/5) = \\tan^{-1}(1/3)$.\nSo RHS = $\\tan^{-1}(2) - \\tan^{-1}(1/3) = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{2-1/3}{1+2/3}) = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{5/3}{5/3}) = \\tan^{-1}(1) = \\pi/4$. So $\\theta=\\pi/4$ is a solution.\n\nIf $t=-1$: $\tan \\theta = -1$. The value of $\\theta$ in $(-3\\pi/4, 3\\pi/4)$ is $\\theta = -\\pi/4$. (This satisfies $-3 \\le t \\le 3$).\nCheck: LHS = $-\\pi/4$. RHS = $\\tan^{-1}(-2) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(\\frac{-6}{10}) = -\\tan^{-1}(2) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(3/5)$.\nSince $t/3 = -1/3 \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\sin^{-1}(3/5) = \\tan^{-1}(1/3)$.\nSo RHS = $-\\tan^{-1}(2) + \\tan^{-1}(1/3) = -(\\tan^{-1}(2) - \\tan^{-1}(1/3)) = -\\tan^{-1}(1) = -\\pi/4$. So $\\theta=-\\pi/4$ is a solution.\n\nSo far, we have 3 solutions: $0, \\pi/4, -\\pi/4$.\n\nCase 2: $t/3 > 1 \\implies t > 3$.\nThis implies $\\phi \\in (\\pi/4, \\pi/2)$. Thus, $2\\phi \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$.\nIn this range, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(2\\phi)) = \\pi - 2\\phi = \\pi - 2 \\tan^{-1}(t/3)$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2t) - \\frac{1}{2} (\\pi - 2 \\tan^{-1}(t/3))$\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2t) - \\pi/2 + \\tan^{-1}(t/3)$\n\nWe use the identity $\\tan^{-1} A + \\tan^{-1} B = \\pi + \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{A+B}{1-AB})$ if $A>0, B>0, AB>1$.\nSince $t>3$, $2t>0$ and $t/3>0$. Also $AB = 2t^2/3 > 2(3^2)/3 = 6 > 1$.\nSo, $\\theta = \\pi + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2t + t/3}{1 - 2t^2/3}\\right) - \\pi/2 = \\pi/2 + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7t/3}{(3-2t^2)/3}\\right) = \\pi/2 + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}\\right)$.\n\nTaking $\\tan$ on both sides:\n$\\tan \\theta = \\tan\\left(\\pi/2 + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}\\right)\\right)$\n$\\tan \\theta = -\\cot\\left(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}} = -\\frac{3-2t^2}{7t}$\nSubstitute $t = \\tan \\theta$:\n$t = -\\frac{3-2t^2}{7t}$\n$7t^2 = -(3-2t^2) \\implies 7t^2 = -3+2t^2 \\implies 5t^2 = -3 \\implies t^2 = -3/5$.\nThis equation has no real solutions for $t$. Thus, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nCase 3: $t/3 < -1 \\implies t < -3$.\nThis implies $\\phi \\in (-\\pi/2, -\\pi/4)$. Thus, $2\\phi \\in (-\\pi, -\\pi/2)$.\nIn this range, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(2\\phi)) = -\\pi - 2\\phi = -\\pi - 2 \\tan^{-1}(t/3)$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2t) - \\frac{1}{2} (-\\pi - 2 \\tan^{-1}(t/3))$\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2t) + \\pi/2 + \\tan^{-1}(t/3)$\n\nWe use the identity $\\tan^{-1} A + \\tan^{-1} B = -\\pi + \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{A+B}{1-AB})$ if $A<0, B<0, AB>1$.\nSince $t<-3$, $2t<0$ and $t/3<0$. Also $AB = 2t^2/3 > 2(-3)^2/3 = 6 > 1$.\nSo, $\\theta = -\\pi + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2t + t/3}{1 - 2t^2/3}\\right) + \\pi/2 = -\\pi/2 + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}\\right)$.\n\nTaking $\\tan$ on both sides:\n$\\tan \\theta = \\tan\\left(-\\pi/2 + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}\\right)\\right)$\n$\\tan \\theta = -\\cot\\left(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{7t}{3-2t^2}} = -\\frac{3-2t^2}{7t}$\nSubstitute $t = \\tan \\theta$:\n$t = -\\frac{3-2t^2}{7t}$\n$7t^2 = -(3-2t^2) \\implies 7t^2 = -3+2t^2 \\implies 5t^2 = -3 \\implies t^2 = -3/5$.\nThis equation has no real solutions for $t$. Thus, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nIn summary, the only real solutions come from Case 1, which are $\\theta = 0, \\pi/4, -\\pi/4$. All these solutions lie within the required range $(-3\\pi/4, 3\\pi/4)$.\n\nThe total number of real solutions is 3."

      "reasoning": "The problem asks us to find the locus of the point of intersection of two given lines, then find a tangent to this locus with specific properties, and finally calculate the product of its intercepts.\n\n**Step 1: Find the locus S.**\nThe given pair of lines are:\n1. $4x - 3y = 12\\alpha$  (Equation 1)\n2. $4\\alpha x + 3\\alpha y = 12$ (Equation 2)\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express $\\alpha$: $\\alpha = \\frac{4x - 3y}{12}$.\nFrom Equation 2, we can factor out $\\alpha$: $\\alpha(4x + 3y) = 12$. This implies $\\alpha = \\frac{12}{4x + 3y}$ (assuming $4x+3y \neq 0$).\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\alpha$:\n$\\frac{4x - 3y}{12} = \\frac{12}{4x + 3y}$\n$(4x - 3y)(4x + 3y) = 12 \times 12$\nUsing the difference of squares formula $(A-B)(A+B) = A^2 - B^2$:\n$(4x)^2 - (3y)^2 = 144$\n$16x^2 - 9y^2 = 144$\n\nTo get the standard form of a hyperbola, divide by 144:\n$\\frac{16x^2}{144} - \\frac{9y^2}{144} = 1$\n$\\frac{x^2}{9} - \\frac{y^2}{16} = 1$\nThis is the equation of the locus S, which is a hyperbola with $a^2 = 9$ and $b^2 = 16$. Thus, $a=3$ and $b=4$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equation of the tangent T.**\nThe tangent T passes through the points $(p, 0)$ and $(0, q)$, with $q > 0$. The equation of a line passing through these intercepts is $\\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1$.\nWe can rewrite this in slope-intercept form: $\\frac{y}{q} = 1 - \\frac{x}{p} \\implies y = -\\frac{q}{p}x + q$.\nSo, the slope of T is $m_T = -\\frac{q}{p}$ and the y-intercept is $q$.\n\nThe tangent T is parallel to the line $4x - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}y = 0$. The slope of this line is $m_L = -\\frac{4}{-3/\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nSince T is parallel to this line, their slopes are equal: $m_T = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nTherefore, $-\\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\n\nThe equation of a tangent to the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ with slope $m$ is given by $y = mx \\pm \\sqrt{a^2m^2 - b^2}$.\nSubstitute $a^2 = 9$, $b^2 = 16$, and $m = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$:\n$y = \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)x \\pm \\sqrt{9\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)^2 - 16}$\n$y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x \\pm \\sqrt{9\\left(\\frac{16 \times 2}{9}\right) - 16}$\n$y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x \\pm \\sqrt{32 - 16}$\n$y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x \\pm \\sqrt{16}$\n$y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x \\pm 4$\n\nWe have two possible tangent lines: $y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x + 4$ and $y = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}x - 4$.\nComparing these with the general form of T, $y = -\\frac{q}{p}x + q$, we see that the y-intercept is $q$.\nSo, $q = 4$ or $q = -4$.

Since $x > x-1$, it implies $\\sqrt{x} > \\sqrt{x-1}$.\nTherefore, $y=\\sqrt{x}$ is the upper curve and $y=\\sqrt{x-1}$ is the lower curve.\n\nArea of $R = \\int_1^4 (\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{x-1}) dx$.\nWe can split this into two integrals:\nArea of $R = \\int_1^4 x^{1/2} dx - \\int_1^4 (x-1)^{1/2} dx$.\n\nCalculate the first integral:\n$\\int_1^4 x^{1/2} dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^{3/2}}{3/2} \\right]_1^4 = \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2} \\right]_1^4$\n$= \\frac{2}{3}(4^{3/2} - 1^{3/2}) = \\frac{2}{3}( (2^2)^{3/2} - 1) = \\frac{2}{3}(2^3 - 1) = \\frac{2}{3}(8-1) = \\frac{2}{3}(7) = \\frac{14}{3}$.\n\nCalculate the second integral:\n$\\int_1^4 (x-1)^{1/2} dx = \\left[ \\frac{(x-1)^{3/2}}{3/2} \\right]_1^4 = \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}(x-1)^{3/2} \\right]_1^4$\n$= \\frac{2}{3}((4-1)^{3/2} - (1-1)^{3/2}) = \\frac{2}{3}(3^{3/2} - 0^{3/2}) = \\frac{2}{3}(3\\sqrt{3} - 0) = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, subtract the second result from the first:\nArea of $R = \\frac{14}{3} - 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Check options (C) and (D) using the calculated area.**\n(C) Area of $R$ is $\\frac{14}{3} - 2\\sqrt{3}$.

      "reasoning": "The problem asks for the ratio of frequencies of oscillation for a uniform rod hinged at one end, under two different spring configurations. We need to analyze each case separately to find the effective torsional spring constant and then use the formula for frequency of angular simple harmonic motion.\n\n**General Formula for Angular SHM:**\nFor a system undergoing angular SHM, the equation of motion is $I \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -\\tau_{restoring}$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia about the pivot and $\\tau_{restoring}$ is the restoring torque. The angular frequency is given by $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff}}{I}}$, where $k_{eff}$ is the effective torsional spring constant (restoring torque per unit angular displacement). The frequency of oscillation is $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$.\n\nIn both cases, the rod is uniform and hinged at O, so its moment of inertia $I$ about O is the same. Since $I$ will cancel out in the ratio, we don't need its explicit value ($I = \\frac{1}{3}Ml^2$). We are also told to ignore gravity and assume small angular displacements, which allows us to use the small angle approximation ($\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1$).\n\n**Case 1: Fig. 1**\nIn this configuration, one spring is connected at the midpoint (O') at $l/2$ from O, and another spring is connected at the top end (O') at $l$ from O. Both springs have the same spring constant $k$.\n\nLet the rod be displaced by a small angle $\\theta$ from its vertical equilibrium position.\n\n1.  **Spring at $l/2$:**\n    The displacement of the point where the spring is attached is $x_1 = (l/2)\\sin\\theta \\approx (l/2)\\theta$ (for small $\\theta$).\n    The force exerted by this spring is $F_1 = kx_1 = k(l/2)\\theta$.\n    The torque due to this spring about O is $\\tau_1 = F_1 \\times (l/2)\\cos\\theta \\approx F_1 \\times (l/2) = k(l/2)\\theta \\times (l/2) = k\\frac{l^2}{4}\\theta$.\n\n2.  **Spring at $l$:**\n    The displacement of the point where this spring is attached is $x_2 = l\\sin\\theta \\approx l\\theta$.\n    The force exerted by this spring is $F_2 = kx_2 = kl\\theta$.\n    The torque due to this spring about O is $\\tau_2 = F_2 \\times l\\cos\\theta \\approx F_2 \\times l = kl\\theta \\times l = kl^2\\theta$.\n\nBoth torques act in the same direction to restore the rod to its vertical position. So, the total restoring torque $\\tau_{restoring,1}$ is the sum of $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$:\n$\\tau_{restoring,1} = \\tau_1 + \\tau_2 = k\\frac{l^2}{4}\\theta + kl^2\\theta = kl^2\\left(\\frac{1}{4} + 1\\right)\\theta = kl^2\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)\\theta$.\n\nFrom this, the effective torsional spring constant for Case 1 is $k_{eff,1} = k\\frac{5l^2}{4}$.\nThe frequency $f_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,1}}{I}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{5kl^2}{4I}}$.\n\n**Case 2: Fig. 2**\nIn this configuration, both springs are connected at the midpoint (O') at $l/2$ from O.\n\nLet the rod be displaced by a small angle $\\theta$ from its vertical equilibrium position.\n\n1.  **Both springs at $l/2$:**\n    The displacement of the point where both springs are attached is $x = (l/2)\\sin\\theta \\approx (l/2)\\theta$.\n    Since both springs are connected at the same point and act in parallel (their forces add up), the total force exerted by the two springs is $F_{total} = kx + kx = 2kx = 2k(l/2)\\theta = kl\\theta$.\n    The torque due to these springs about O is $\\tau_{restoring,2} = F_{total} \\times (l/2)\\cos\\theta \\approx F_{total} \\times (l/2) = kl\\theta \\times (l/2) = k\\frac{l^2}{2}\\theta$.\n\nFrom this, the effective torsional spring constant for Case 2 is $k_{eff,2} = k\\frac{l^2}{2}$.\nThe frequency $f_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,2}}{I}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{kl^2}{2I}}$.\n\n**Ratio of Frequencies:**\nNow, we need to find the ratio $\\frac{f_1}{f_2}$:\n$\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{5kl^2}{4I}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{kl^2}{2I}}}$\n$\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{5kl^2}{4I}}{\\frac{kl^2}{2I}}}$\n$\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5kl^2}{4I} \\times \\frac{2I}{kl^2}}$\n$\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{4} \\times 2}$\n$\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{4}}$\n$\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option (C).\n\n"

Its potential is constant throughout its volume and on its surface.\n*   The potential of the sphere in the presence of an external point charge is the potential at any point on its surface (or inside).\n*   Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential at its center is the same as the potential on its surface. The potential at the center is solely due to the external point charge, as the induced charges on the neutral sphere sum to zero and their potential contribution at the center is zero.\n*   So, the potential of the sphere, V_sphere = k * q / d₁\n*   V_sphere = (9 × 10⁹ Nm²/C²) * (10⁻⁸ C) / (0.2 m)\n*   V_sphere = (9 × 10) / 0.2 V = 90 / 0.2 V = 450 V.\n*   Therefore, statement (A) is correct.\n\n**Statement (B): Charge flowing from the sphere to the ground because of grounding is 5 × 10⁻⁹ C.**\n*   When the sphere is grounded, its potential becomes zero (V_sphere = 0).\n*   Let Q_g be the charge that flows onto the sphere from the ground (or from the sphere to the ground).

If `y` is positive, `S2P > S1P`).\n    So, `(d * y) / D = (μ_A - μ_B)t`\n\n6.  **Calculate the shift `y`:**\n    `y = [(μ_A - μ_B)t * D] / d`\n    Substitute the given values:\n    `y = [(1.7 - 1.5) * (12 * 10^-6 m) * (2 m)] / (2 * 10^-3 m)`\n    `y = [0.2 * 12 * 10^-6 * 2] / (2 * 10^-3)`\n    `y = [0.2 * 12 * 10^-6] / 10^-3`\n    `y = 0.2 * 12 * 10^(-6 + 3)`\n    `y = 0.2 * 12 * 10^-3`\n    `y = 2.4 * 10^-3 m`\n\n7.  **Convert the shift to millimeters:**\n    `y = 2.4 mm`\n\nSince `μ_A > μ_B`, the term `(μ_A - μ_B)t` is positive. This means `S2P - S1P` is positive, which implies `y` is positive. The shift is upwards (towards the slit with the higher refractive index material, which causes a larger optical path). The question only asks for the magnitude of the shift.\n\nThe value is 2.4. Truncating/rounding to two decimal places gives 2.40."

However, if forced to choose one, both are valid and common reactions for producing dicarboxylic acids. Given the constraints of a single correct answer, and without further context to differentiate between B and C (e.g., specific yield data, industrial preference, or a more specific type of dicarboxylic acid implied), it's challenging to definitively select one over the other based purely on chemical principles. However, the oxidation of alkylbenzenes to carboxylic acids is a very characteristic and clean reaction.\n\nConsidering the common types of reactions taught, both are fundamental.

      "reasoning": "The reaction sequence starts with indene. Let's analyze each step:\n\n**Step 1: Indene $\\xrightarrow{\text{(i) } KMnO_4, H^+, \\Delta}$ Benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid**\nIndene is a bicyclic hydrocarbon consisting of a benzene ring fused to a cyclopentene ring with a double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is a methylene group (CH2). Strong oxidation with hot acidic $KMnO_4$ cleaves the double bond, oxidizing C1 and C2 to carboxylic acid groups (-COOH). Additionally, the benzylic methylene group at C3 is also oxidized to a carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the product of this oxidation is benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid (also known as hemimellitic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid $\\xrightarrow{\text{(ii) } NH_3, \\Delta, -2H_2O}$ X**\nHeating a dicarboxylic acid with ammonia leads to the formation of an imide (if the carboxylic acids are ortho to each other) or an amide. In benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, the -COOH groups at positions 1 and 2 are ortho to each other. They will react with $NH_3$ and undergo dehydration (removal of 2$H_2O$) to form an imide. The -COOH group at position 3 remains. Thus, X is 1,2-phthalimido-3-carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: X $\\xrightarrow{\text{(i) Strong heating} \\ \text{(ii) Ethanolic KOH} \\ \text{(iii) R-Br}}$ Y**\nThis sequence of reactions is characteristic of the Gabriel Phthalimide Synthesis. If X is 1,2-phthalimido-3-carboxylic acid, strong heating (step i) might cause decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid group, leading to the formation of phthalimide. Even if decarboxylation does not occur, the imide nitrogen has an acidic proton. In step (ii), ethanolic KOH deprotonates the imide nitrogen to form a potassium salt (potassium phthalimide or potassium 1,2-phthalimido-3-carboxylate). In step (iii), this potassium salt acts as a nucleophile and reacts with R-Br (an alkyl halide) to form an N-alkylated imide. So, Y is N-R-phthalimide (if decarboxylation occurred) or N-R-phthalimido-3-carboxylic acid (if decarboxylation did not occur). In either case, Y is an N-substituted imide derivative.\n\n**Step 4: Y $\\xrightarrow{NaOH}$ Aromatic compound + Z**\nThis step involves the hydrolysis of the imide (Y) with NaOH. Hydrolysis of N-R-phthalimide (or its carboxylic acid derivative) yields the corresponding phthalate salt (the aromatic compound) and a primary amine, R-$NH_2$. Therefore, Z is R-$NH_2$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n**(A) Both X and Y are oxygen containing compounds.**\nX is 1,2-phthalimido-3-carboxylic acid, which contains carbonyl groups (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Thus, X is an oxygen-containing compound.\nY is N-R-phthalimide (or N-R-phthalimido-3-carboxylic acid), which also contains carbonyl groups (C=O) and potentially a carboxylic acid group. Thus, Y is also an oxygen-containing compound.\nTherefore, statement (A) is correct.\n\n**(B) Y on heating with $CHCl_3$/KOH forms isocyanide.**\nThe carbylamine reaction (formation of isocyanide with $CHCl_3$/KOH) is a test for primary amines (R-$NH_2$ or Ar-$NH_2$). Y is an N-substituted imide, not a primary amine. Therefore, Y will not give the carbylamine reaction.\nTherefore, statement (B) is incorrect.\n\n**(C) Z reacts with Hinsberg's reagent.**\nZ is R-$NH_2$, which is a primary amine. Primary amines react with Hinsberg's reagent (benzene sulfonyl chloride, $C_6H_5SO_2Cl$) to form N-alkylbenzenesulfonamides, which are soluble in KOH. Secondary amines form N,N-dialkylbenzenesulfonamides, which are insoluble in KOH. Tertiary amines do not react. Since Z is a primary amine, it will react with Hinsberg's reagent.\nTherefore, statement (C) is correct.\n\n**(D) Z is an aromatic primary amine.**\nZ is R-$NH_2$. In the Gabriel Phthalimide Synthesis, R-Br is typically an alkyl halide because aryl halides (Ar-Br) are generally unreactive towards $S_N2$ displacement by the phthalimide anion. Therefore, R is most likely an alkyl group, making Z an aliphatic primary amine, not an aromatic primary amine.\nTherefore, statement (D) is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements (A) and (C) are correct."

Based on the structure provided, it is 6-phenyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n$\\xrightarrow{LiAlH_4}$ P\n$LiAlH_4$ is a strong reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols. For a lactone, it opens the ring to form a diol. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and the carbon attached to the ester oxygen becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(Ph)OH).\nSo, P is HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(Ph)-OH, which is 6-phenylhexane-1,6-diol.\n\n**Analysis of Statement (A): P is optically active.**\nThe carbon atom bearing the phenyl group in P (CH(Ph)-OH) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -Ph, -OH, and -CH2CH2CH2CH2OH. Therefore, P is optically active. Statement (A) is correct.\n\n**2. P to Q:**\nP $\\xrightarrow{CrO_3-H_2SO_4}$ Q\n$CrO_3-H_2SO_4$ (Jones reagent) is a strong oxidizing agent. It oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.\nIn P, the -CH2OH group (primary alcohol) will be oxidized to -COOH (carboxylic acid).\nThe -CH(Ph)OH group (secondary alcohol) will be oxidized to -C(=O)Ph (ketone).\nSo, Q is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-Ph, which is 5-oxo-5-phenylpentanoic acid.\n\n**Analysis of Statement (C): Q gives effervescence with aq. $NaHCO_3$.**\nQ is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids react with aqueous sodium bicarbonate ($NaHCO_3$) to produce carbon dioxide gas, which causes effervescence (R-COOH + $NaHCO_3$ $\rightarrow$ R-COONa + $H_2O$ + $CO_2$). Therefore, statement (C) is correct.\n\n**3. Q to R:**\nQ $\\xrightarrow{NaOH \text{ and } CaO, \\Delta}$ R\nThis is a soda lime decarboxylation reaction, which removes the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) as $CO_2$.\nSo, R is CH3-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-Ph, which is 1-phenylbutan-1-one (or butanophenone).\n\n**Analysis of Statement (D): R is an alkyne.**\nR is a ketone, not an alkyne (which contains a carbon-carbon triple bond). Therefore, statement (D) is incorrect.\n\n**4. P to S:**\nP $\\xrightarrow{H_2SO_4, 443 K}$ S\nP is 6-phenylhexane-1,6-diol. The conditions ($H_2SO_4$, 443 K or 170 °C) indicate acid-catalyzed dehydration of alcohols.\nFor diols, this reaction can lead to cyclic ethers or alkenes/dienes.\n\nPossible products from dehydration of P:\n*   **Cyclic Ether:** Intramolecular dehydration can form a 6-membered cyclic ether, 2-phenyltetrahydro-2H-pyran. This product does not contain any C=C bonds.\n*   **Alkenes/Dienes:** Dehydration can also lead to the formation of C=C bonds. For example, dehydration of the secondary benzylic alcohol (-CH(Ph)OH) with a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon (C5) would form HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=C(Ph)H (6-phenylhex-5-en-1-ol). This alkene is conjugated with the phenyl group, making it a stable product. Another possibility is dehydration of the primary alcohol, or double dehydration to form a diene (e.g., 6-phenylhexa-1,5-diene).\n\n**Analysis of Statement (B): S gives Bayer's test.**\nBayer's test (cold, dilute, alkaline $KMnO_4$) is used to detect unsaturation (C=C or C≡C bonds). If S contains any alkene or alkyne, it will give a positive Bayer's test.\nGiven the harsh conditions ($H_2SO_4, 443 K$), elimination reactions to form alkenes are highly probable. The formation of 6-phenylhex-5-en-1-ol (an alkene) is a very plausible outcome due to the stability of the benzylic carbocation intermediate and the resulting conjugated alkene. Even if the cyclic ether is a major product, the formation of some alkene is expected under these conditions. If S is a mixture containing an alkene, or if an alkene is a significant product, then S will give a positive Bayer's test. Therefore, statement (B) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStatements (A), (B), and (C) are correct. Statement (D) is incorrect."

Therefore, Interpretation A is incorrect.\n\nInterpretation B: These are the equilibrium concentrations (`C_e`) of phenol in the aqueous solution.\n   So, the given data points are:\n   Data Point 1: `C_e1 = 10 mg g⁻¹`, `q1 = 4 mg g⁻¹`\n   Data Point 2: `C_e2 = 16 mg g⁻¹`, `q2 = 10 mg g⁻¹`\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with how adsorption isotherm data is typically presented and allows for a valid solution using the Freundlich isotherm.\n\nNow, we apply the Freundlich isotherm equation in its logarithmic form: `log q = log K + (1/n) log C_e`\n\nFor Data Point 1:\n`log 4 = log K + (1/n) log 10`  (Equation 1)\n\nFor Data Point 2:\n`log 10 = log K + (1/n) log 16` (Equation 2)\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(log 10 - log 4) = (log K - log K) + (1/n) (log 16 - log 10)`\n`log (10/4) = (1/n) log (16/10)`\n`log 2.5 = (1/n) log 1.6`\n\nWe are given `log₁₀ 2 = 0.3`.\nLet's calculate the log values:\n`log 2.5 = log (5/2) = log 5 - log 2 = (log 10 - log 2) - log 2 = 1 - 2 * log 2 = 1 - 2 * 0.3 = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4`\n`log 1.6 = log (16/10) = log 16 - log 10 = log (2^4) - 1 = 4 * log 2 - 1 = 4 * 0.3 - 1 = 1.2 - 1 = 0.2`\n\nSubstitute these values back into the equation:\n`0.4 = (1/n) * 0.2`\n`1/n = 0.4 / 0.2 = 2`\n\nNow, substitute `1/n = 2` into Equation 1 to find `log K`:\n`log 4 = log K + 2 * log 10`\n`log 4 = log K + 2 * 1`\n`log K = log 4 - 2`\n`log K = log (2^2) - 2 = 2 * log 2 - 2 = 2 * 0.3 - 2 = 0.6 - 2 = -1.4`\n\nTo find K, we calculate `K = 10^(-1.4)`:\n`K = 10^(-1.4) = 10^(0.6 - 2) = 10^(0.6) * 10^(-2)`\nSince `log 4 = 0.6`, `10^(0.6) = 4`.\n`K = 4 * 10^(-2) = 4 * 0.01 = 0.04`\n\nFinally, we need to find the concentration of adsorbed phenol (`q`) from a 20 mg g⁻¹ aqueous solution of phenol. This means `C_e = 20 mg g⁻¹` for the new case.\n\n`q = K * C_e^(1/n)`\n`q = 0.04 * (20)^2`\n`q = 0.04 * 400`\n`q = 16`\n\nThe concentration of adsorbed phenol is 16 mg g⁻¹."
